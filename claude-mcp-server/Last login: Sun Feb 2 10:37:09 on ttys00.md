( O)> Below is a concise overview capturing the essential ideas from the provided documentation on GenAIScript’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools. Think of this summary as a quick-reference guide to how GenAIScript uses MCP, how ephemeral tool servers are defined and managed, and how Docker can be leveraged for local/offline development.

1. What the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Is
 • Purpose: MCP is a standard for integrating external “tools”—functions or endpoints—into AI workflows. It specifies how to discover, invoke, and manage these tools using a uniform JSON-RPC interface.
 • Client–Server Model: AI clients (e.g., GenAIScript, Claude Desktop) talk to servers that expose various tools (e.g., filesystem, Git, Python code execution).

2. GenAIScript’s Approach to MCP Tools
1. defTool Configuration
 • You declare servers (e.g., filesystem, memory) via defTool({ ... }).
 • Each server corresponds to a command (like npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory) that runs as an MCP server.
 • Ephemeral Servers: They start up when you render a prompt and shut down once the prompt session completes.
2. Lifecycle Management
 • Startup: Each tool server spins up just before the AI prompt that needs it.
 • Shutdown: Servers stop automatically after the session.
 • Inline Prompts: If you define servers inline, GenAIScript launches them for that prompt only, then kills them afterward.
3. Tool Discovery & Namespacing
 • Tools from a server are automatically registered and exposed to the LLM.
 • The tool IDs are often prefixed (like filesystem_read_file) to avoid naming clashes.
 • You can discover available MCP servers (and their exposed tools) via resources like the Model Context Protocol Servers project.
4. Common Built-In Tools
 • Filesystem: fs_read_file, fs_diff_files, etc.
 • Git/Version Control: git_status, git_diff, etc.
 • Math/Computation: math_eval, python_code_interpreter_run.
 • Retrieval/Search: retrieval_web_search, etc.
 • User Interaction: user_input_confirm, etc.
 • Media: video_extract_audio, vision_ask_images, etc.

3. Dockerizing MCP Servers

Why Docker?
 • Isolation: Each MCP server (memory, filesystem, custom) can run in a container, simplifying dependency management.
 • Lifecycle & Scalability: Easy to spin up/down multiple servers, orchestrate them via Docker Compose, and ensure consistent environments for local or dev usage.

Example Dockerfiles

 1. Memory Server (Node + @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory)

FROM node:18-alpine
RUN npm install -g npx
CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]

 2. Filesystem Server (Node + @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem)

FROM node:18-alpine
RUN npm install -g npx
CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]

 3. Custom MCP Server
 • Combine multiple tools in one container.
 • Write your own server.js that registers tools (e.g. using a function like defTool) and responds to MCP requests.

Multi-Server Setup with Docker Compose
 • You can define multiple services (memory, filesystem, custom) in a single docker-compose.yml.
 • Each container exposes a port, letting AI clients (Claude, GenAIScript, etc.) discover and call them as needed.

4. Example: Registering Tools in a Custom MCP Server
 • Registry Model: A helper like defTool(toolId, schema, callback) stores tool definitions.
 • MCP Server Class: A server listens for JSON-RPC requests.
 • Example Tools:
 • python_code_interpreter_run (executes Python or calls an external API).
 • fs_read_file (reads file from disk).

// Register the tool in your server code
defTool("fs_read_file", "Reads a file", { filePath: "string" }, async ({ filePath }) => {
  return fs.readFile(filePath, "utf-8");
});

 • Integration: Clients (like GenAIScript or Claude Desktop) see these tools automatically once the server is up.

5. Advanced Topics & Best Practices
1. Transport Choices
 • Stdio for local process integration.
 • HTTP/SSE for remote or container-based usage.
 • WebSockets for real-time interactions (e.g., in a live-coding IDE).
2. Security
 • Consider authentication (API keys, OAuth, TLS).
 • Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.
3. Lifecycle & Error Handling
 • Cleanly start/stop ephemeral servers.
 • Use standardized JSON-RPC error codes for debugging.
4. Tool Schema & Discovery
 • Provide clear JSON schemas for each tool’s parameters.
 • Let clients query tools/list or prompts/list endpoints for dynamic usage.
5. Agentic Workflows
 • Tools can chain: e.g., read a file, do a diff, run Python on the results.
6. Local vs. Remote
 • Docker images let you run everything locally for offline dev.
 • Or push to a remote environment with the same config.

6. Putting It All Together
 • GenAIScript + MCP:
 • Ephemeral tool servers declared via defTool.
 • Automatic start/stop ensures they run only when needed.
 • Tools become function calls accessible to the LLM in GenAIScript prompts.
 • Docker:
 • Eases local development, ensuring each MCP server’s environment is consistent.
 • Allows you to test multiple servers (filesystem, memory, custom) simultaneously with Docker Compose.
 • Use Cases
 • Extend AI scripts with file operations, code interpretation, Git management, or web search.
 • Combine or chain these tools in a single ephemeral session, or break them out into separate containers.
 • Integration Examples
 • In Claude Desktop: Provide the local MCP server’s endpoint in the config.
 • In a cursor-based IDE: Use a plugin that queries the MCP server for available tools and runs them on-demand.

Final Thoughts

The documentation underscores how GenAIScript and MCP combine to give AI models a powerful, standardized way to access external functions—without locking you into a single environment or runtime. By packaging tools as ephemeral servers, you keep each session lightweight and secure. And by leveraging Docker, you can develop and test these integrations both locally (for offline dev) and in scalable production deployments.

alable, local, and secure environments. With configurable tools, agents can achieve complex, chained tasks seamlessly across local and production setups.

Let me know if you'd like clarification or details on specific sections!

( O)> The page you referenced is part of the GenAIScript documentation and explains how GenAIScript integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to support portable tool definitions. In summary:

Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is an emerging standard that defines a protocol for sharing tools and consuming them in a uniform way regardless of the underlying framework or runtime. GenAIScript implements a client for MCP tools so that you can integrate external tool servers seamlessly into your AI scripts.

Configuring Servers

You can declare a set of server configurations using the defTool function. This configuration is similar to what you’d specify in the Claude configuration file. For example, you can set up servers to provide memory and filesystem functionalities:

defTool({
    memory: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    },
    filesystem: {
        command: "npx",
        args: [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            path.resolve("."),
        ],
    },
})

When you do this, GenAIScript will launch the specified server and automatically register all the tools provided by that server. The registered tool identifiers are prefixed (e.g., server_toolname) to avoid naming conflicts.

Lifecycle of Servers

The documentation explains that:
 • Startup: Servers are started when rendering the prompt.
 • Shutdown: They are stopped once the chat session is completed.
 • Inline Prompts: If you define servers in an inline prompt, the server is started and stopped for each such prompt.

This design ensures that your tool servers are active only as long as needed for the specific prompt session.

Finding Servers

For discovering available MCP servers, the documentation points you to the Model Context Protocol Servers project. This external resource provides a list of ready-to-use server implementations, allowing you to quickly incorporate a variety of tools into your GenAIScript workflows.

Conclusion

In essence, the Model Context Protocol Tools documentation for GenAIScript guides you through how to:
 • Define server configurations using defTool.
 • Integrate these servers so that the LLM can call on them as tools.
 • Manage the lifecycle of these servers efficiently during prompt execution.

This integration makes it easier to extend your scripts with additional functionalities (like memory or filesystem operations) provided by external tool servers, all while adhering to a standardized protocol.

If you have any more questions about using MCP tools in your GenAIScript projects, feel free to ask!

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn’t so much about prescribing a fixed list of “Gen AI tools” as it is about defining a standard way for AI applications to integrate external functions—that is, “tools”—into their workflows. In other words, MCP provides the plumbing for clients (like GenAIScript) to discover, invoke, and manage tools regardless of the underlying implementation. Below is an overview of what this means in practice:

MCP and Tool Integration in Gen AI

1. The Role of Tools in MCP
 • Framework for Interoperability: MCP establishes a client–server architecture where “tools” are simply functions (or endpoints) that can be invoked by an AI client.
 • Standard Messaging: Whether it’s a file operation, a Git command, a web search, or a math evaluation, tools are communicated via a standardized JSON‑RPC message format over transports (like stdio or HTTP with SSE).
 • Dynamic Discovery: Clients can query MCP servers for available prompts and tools. For example, an endpoint like prompts/list lets a client know what reusable prompt templates (and, by extension, tools) are available.

2. Feature Support Matrix in the MCP Document
The document (from modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt  ￼) includes a matrix of client applications that support various MCP features. In this matrix, “Tools” is one of the key features—indicating that a given client can execute external tool functions. For example:
 • Claude Desktop App, Firebase Genkit, Continue, GenAIScript, Cline, LibreChat, TheiaAI/TheiaIDE, Superinterface, 5ire, and Bee Agent Framework all support MCP tools.
This means these clients can call out to external functions (tools) as part of their conversational or code-assistance workflows.

GenAIScript’s Approach to Tools

While MCP sets the protocol, platforms like GenAIScript provide concrete tool definitions that you can use. In GenAIScript (which implements an MCP client), tools are defined using the defTool function. These tools are essentially JavaScript functions that can be invoked by the language model during prompt assembly. Some examples of the kinds of tools provided in GenAIScript include:
 • File System Tools:
 • fs_ask_file – Query file content.
 • fs_read_file – Read text from a file.
 • fs_diff_files – Compute differences between files.
 • Version Control Tools:
 • git_status, git_diff – Get repository status or compute file diffs.
 • Other Git operations like listing branches or commits.
 • GitHub Integration:
 • Tools for listing pull requests, issues, and file contents from GitHub repositories.
 • Math and Computation Tools:
 • math_eval – Evaluate arithmetic or mathematical expressions.
 • Markdown and Metadata Tools:
 • md_find_files, md_read_frontmatter – Work with markdown documentation.
 • meta_prompt, meta_schema – Generate schema or process prompt metadata.
 • Code Interpreter Tools:
 • python_code_interpreter_run and related functions enable running Python code in a sandbox.
 • Retrieval and Search Tools:
 • retrieval_web_search, retrieval_vector_search – Perform web or vector-based searches.
 • Media and Vision Tools:
 • video_probe, video_extract_audio, video_extract_frames – Process video files.
 • vision_ask_images – Analyze images via AI vision models.
 • User Interaction Tools:
 • user_input_confirm, user_input_select, user_input_text – Get confirmation or input from the user.

Each of these tools is registered in the GenAIScript environment so that when an LLM is assembling an answer, it can decide to invoke one of these functions if it determines that additional context or a computation is needed.

Summary
 • MCP’s Role: MCP defines how AI applications exchange tool calls, prompts, and resources in a standardized way. It doesn’t fix a particular set of tools but rather defines how tools should be integrated.
 • GenAIScript Example: In GenAIScript, developers can define a rich set of tools (from file system queries to Git operations and math evaluations) using a simple JavaScript API (defTool). This allows the LLM to augment its answers by, for example, reading files, running computations, or even fetching web data.
 • Ecosystem Support: The MCP document shows that many Gen AI platforms support tool integration. The “Tools” column in the feature support matrix highlights which clients (like GenAIScript) have built-in support for these dynamic functions.

This flexible, protocol-based approach is at the heart of modern Gen AI systems, enabling them to extend their capabilities far beyond plain text generation by leveraging external tools and data sources.B

This outline provides a roadmap for leveraging the MCP support matrix to integrate and deploy valuable tools across various MCP-enabled environments. By following these guidelines, developers can extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and other related server configurations using custom Docker setups—all while maintaining compatibility and adhering to MCP’s standards.

Below are several Dockerfile configuration templates for MCP servers that you might run locally. These templates target different MCP tool servers—such as a memory server, a filesystem server, and a custom MCP server (for example, one that might integrate additional tools for local use). You can use these templates to build local Docker images that provide MCP functionality for clients like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or even for specialized “cursor” MCP workflows.

1. Dockerfile for an MCP Memory Server

This template is designed for a Node.js–based MCP memory server. It uses a lightweight Alpine image and invokes the MCP memory server through npx. (This is useful when you want a local in-memory store for context or session data.)

# Dockerfile for MCP Memory Server

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Ensure npx is available (it is bundled with Node.js, but installing globally ensures latest behavior)

RUN npm install -g npx

# (Optional) Expose a port if your memory server also supports network-based transports

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP memory server using npx

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-memory-server .

Then run locally. This container will launch the memory server for local MCP integration.

2. Dockerfile for an MCP Filesystem Server

This template is similar to the memory server but tailored for a filesystem server. It assumes the server will work on a local directory (for example, to offer file read/diff capabilities). You can mount a host volume so that the server operates on your local files.

# Dockerfile for MCP Filesystem Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install -g npx

# Expose a port if your configuration uses HTTP/SSE transports (optional)

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP filesystem server

# Here, "/data" is used as the target directory inside the container

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-filesystem-server .

Run with a volume mount so that your local directory is available inside the container:

docker run -v "$(pwd)/my-local-data:/data" -p 3000:3000 mcp-filesystem-server

3. Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server with Additional Tools

If you need a custom MCP server that registers extra tools or integrates custom logic (for instance, combining file, Git, or code interpreter tools into a single server), you can create a Node.js–based server. Place your custom server code (e.g., in a file called custom-server.js) in your project, then use the following Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy your custom MCP server code and any additional files

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your custom server communicates over HTTP or SSE

EXPOSE 3000

# Start your custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "custom-server.js"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t custom-mcp-server .

Run locally with

docker run -p 3000:3000 custom-mcp-server

Your custom-server.js might include logic to register multiple tools (using the MCP protocol) for handling tasks such as file diffs, Git operations, or even interactive prompts. This gives you the flexibility to tailor the MCP server’s behavior for local development or for specialized use cases (such as “cursor” MCP servers).

4. Optional: Docker Compose for Multi-Server Local Development

If you need to run several MCP servers concurrently (for example, one for memory, one for filesystem, and one custom server), you can use a Docker Compose file:

version: '3'
services:
  mcp-memory:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-memory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"

  mcp-filesystem:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-filesystem
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"

  custom-mcp:
    build:
      context: ./custom-mcp
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"

Usage:
Place each Dockerfile in its respective subdirectory (e.g., ./mcp-memory, ./mcp-filesystem, ./custom-mcp), then run:

docker-compose up --build

This setup lets you develop and test local MCP integrations across multiple servers simultaneously.

Conclusion

These Dockerfile templates provide a foundation for local MCP server deployments. They are intended for use in environments like Claude Desktop MCP or emerging clients such as Goose MCP, where running MCP servers locally can enhance privacy, performance, and ease of testing. You can further customize these templates to include additional tools or modify their transport configurations as needed by your local development or production workflow.

Below is an example Dockerfile that sets up a custom MCP server container. In this example, the container is built from a Node.js base image (using Debian‑based “slim” images) and installs Python alongside the Node environment. This enables you to integrate both:

 1. Code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API (for example, via a registered tool that calls out to a Python subprocess with required libraries), and
 2. GenAIScript tools from the MCP support matrix (which you would register in your custom server code).

In your custom server code (for example, in a file named server.js), you would use the MCP protocol to register tools such as a python_code_interpreter_run tool along with other GenAIScript functions. (The server code is not shown here, but it would follow the guidelines for using MCP and defTool to register your tools.)

Below is the Dockerfile:

# Use a Node.js slim image that supports apt-get

FROM node:18-slim

# Install Python3 and pip so that the container can run Python-based code interpreter tools

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How This Dockerfile Works

 1. Base Image and Python Setup:
 • The image starts with a Node.js base (node:18-slim).
 • It installs Python 3 and pip so that Python-based tools (such as a code interpreter module) can run.
 • It then installs the required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that are typically allowed for the code interpreter tool.
 2. Node.js Environment and Dependencies:
 • The working directory is set to /app where the Node.js server code resides.
 • The Node dependencies (including any MCP/GenAIScript libraries) are installed via npm.
 3. Custom MCP Server Code:
 • Your application code (for example, server.js) is copied into the container. This code is expected to use the MCP protocol to register tools:
 • A tool that leverages the OpenAI Assistance API for code interpretation (for instance, by invoking Python scripts or making API calls).
 • Additional GenAIScript tools (such as file system operations, Git commands, or other utility functions from the MCP matrix).
 4. Port Exposure and Execution:
 • The container exposes port 3000 if needed for HTTP/SSE transport.
 • Finally, the container is configured to start the MCP server by running node server.js.

This template provides a starting point for integrating both types of tools in a Dockerized local MCP server. You can further customize the server code and environment variables as needed for your specific integration scenario.

Below is an example and explanation that describe how you can register your custom server code to expose GenAIScript (or “Jeni script”) tools via MCP. In this example, we show how to define two types of tools—a code interpreter tool (which might call the OpenAI Assistance API or run Python code locally) and a file system tool (as an example from the MCP support matrix). You can then register these tools in your custom MCP server code so that MCP‐clients (such as Claude Desktop or Goose MCP) can invoke them.

Example: Custom MCP Server Code Registration

Below is an example of a Node.js script (for example, named server.js) that uses an MCP server SDK (or your own MCP wrapper) to register tools. (Adjust the module names and API calls to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.) In this sample, we use a hypothetical defTool function to register tools and a Server class to launch the MCP server on a selected transport (for example, standard I/O or HTTP).

// server.js
// Import required modules. Adjust these imports to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import fs from "fs/promises";

// A helper function for tool registration. In GenAIScript you might use `defTool`.
// Here, we create a simple registry object.
const toolRegistry = {};

/**

- Registers a tool for the MCP server.
- @param {string} id - The unique tool identifier.
- @param {string} description - A brief description of the tool.
- @param {object} schema - JSON schema for the tool's parameters.
- @param {Function} callback - The function to execute when the tool is called.
 */
function defTool(id, description, schema, callback) {
  toolRegistry[id] = { description, schema, callback };
  console.log(`Registered tool: ${id}`);
}

// Example 1: Code Interpreter Tool
// This tool accepts Python code and returns a simulated output.
// In a real scenario, you might call out to the OpenAI Assistance API or execute code securely.
defTool(
  "python_code_interpreter_run",
  "Executes Python code and returns the result.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      code: { type: "string", description: "Python code to execute" }
    },
    required: ["code"]
  },
  async ({ code }) => {
    // (Placeholder) Simulate executing Python code.
    // In production, you could spawn a Python process or call an external API.
    console.log("Executing Python code:", code);
    // For illustration, return a dummy result.
    return `Executed code: ${code.substring(0, 30)}...`;
  }
);

// Example 2: File Read Tool
// This tool reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.
defTool(
  "fs_read_file",
  "Reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filePath: { type: "string", description: "Absolute or relative file path" }
    },
    required: ["filePath"]
  },
  async ({ filePath }) => {
    try {
      const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");
      return content;
    } catch (err) {
      return `Error reading file: ${err.message}`;
    }
  }
);

// Initialize and start the MCP server.
async function startMcpServer() {
  // Create an instance of your MCP server.
  const server = new Server(
    { name: "custom-mcp-server", version: "1.0.0" },
    {
      // You can declare supported capabilities here.
      capabilities: {
        tools: Object.keys(toolRegistry)
      }
    }
  );

  // Set a generic request handler that dispatches tool calls.
  // In a production implementation, you might match the request's method to a tool ID.
  server.setRequestHandler(async (request) => {
    const { method, params } = request;
    if (toolRegistry[method]) {
      try {
        const result = await toolRegistry[method].callback(params);
        return { result };
      } catch (error) {
        return { error: { message: error.message } };
      }
    } else {
      return { error: { message: `Tool ${method} not found` } };
    }
  });

  // Create a transport (here using standard I/O).
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);

  console.log("MCP server started and awaiting requests...");
}

// Run the server
startMcpServer().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error starting MCP server:", err);
});

Explanation

 1. Tool Registration with defTool:
 • The defTool function is defined to store tool definitions (ID, description, JSON schema, and callback function) in a registry.
 • Two tools are registered:
 • python_code_interpreter_run: Simulates execution of Python code. In a real integration, you could spawn a Python subprocess or call the OpenAI Assistance API.
 • fs_read_file: Reads a file using Node’s filesystem API and returns its content.
 2. Setting Up the MCP Server:
 • A new MCP server instance is created with a name and version. In its capabilities, it declares that it supports the tools whose IDs were registered.
 • A generic request handler is set up so that when a client sends a request with a method corresponding to one of the tool IDs, the server dispatches the call to the registered callback.
 • The server connects using a transport (in this example, a standard I/O transport via StdioServerTransport).
 3. Integration with MCP Clients:
 • Once the server is running, MCP-enabled clients (e.g., Claude Desktop MCP or Goose MCP) can discover the available tools (listed in the capabilities) and invoke them using the MCP protocol.
 • The tool callbacks then execute the custom logic (e.g., interpreting code or reading a file) and return the results.

How to Use This with a Docker Container

You can combine the above server code with the Dockerfile example provided previously. For instance, if your Dockerfile copies this server.js into the container and runs it, you will have a Dockerized custom MCP server that exposes both the code interpreter and GenAIScript tools.

This approach allows you to integrate code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API and other GenAIScript tools (as shown in the MCP support matrix) into a single, custom MCP server that can be deployed locally or via Docker.

Feel free to adjust the tool implementations and server configuration to match your actual application logic and the APIs you are using.

Below are several additional concepts and best practices that are integral to properly configuring and executing MCP protocols. These considerations complement the configuration and tool registration details we’ve discussed:

1. Transport Layer & Communication
 • Multiple Transports:
 • Choose the appropriate transport mechanism (e.g., stdio for local processes, HTTP with SSE for remote or web-based connections) and ensure that the protocol (typically JSON‑RPC 2.0) is consistently followed.
 • Message Framing & Schema Validation:
 • Implement strict JSON schema validation for all messages to ensure that requests, notifications, and error messages adhere to the expected format.
 • This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and injection attacks.

2. Security and Access Controls
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Integrate secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, mutual TLS) to restrict access to MCP servers.
 • Data Integrity & Encryption:
 • Ensure that all data exchanged between clients and servers is encrypted in transit (using TLS/SSL for HTTP-based transports).
 • Input Sanitization:
 • Validate and sanitize all incoming messages and parameters to prevent malicious inputs from causing unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

3. Tool & Prompt Standardization
 • Uniform Schema Definitions:
 • Define clear, reusable JSON schemas for each tool and prompt. This ensures interoperability between various clients (like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or custom implementations).
 • Dynamic Discovery:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., prompts/list or tool registry queries) that allow clients to dynamically discover available tools and prompts.
 • This flexibility aids in integrating new functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

4. Lifecycle Management and Error Handling
 • Startup and Shutdown:
 • Ensure that MCP servers are started at prompt initialization and shut down cleanly at the end of a session to free up resources.
 • Robust Error Handling:
 • Standardize error codes and messages (e.g., following JSON‑RPC error codes) so that clients can properly interpret and react to issues.
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument the server to log incoming requests, responses, errors, and performance metrics.
 • Use health checks and diagnostics to monitor server status, which is especially useful in containerized deployments.

5. Containerization & Deployment Best Practices
 • Docker and Orchestration:
 • Use Docker to encapsulate the MCP server along with its dependencies (e.g., Node.js, Python runtime for code interpreter tools).
 • For more complex deployments, employ orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage multiple MCP servers concurrently.
 • CI/CD Integration:
 • Automate builds, tests, and deployments of MCP server containers to ensure consistency across environments.
 • Versioning:
 • Manage version compatibility between MCP clients and servers, making sure that protocol updates are handled gracefully.

6. Developer Experience and Documentation
 • Comprehensive Documentation:
 • Document tool registration, API endpoints, expected schemas, and error codes clearly.
 • This helps developers integrate new tools and debug issues effectively.
 • Testing and Debugging Tools:
 • Develop unit and integration tests for each registered tool.
 • Use interactive debugging tools (for instance, built into development environments like Visual Studio Code) to simulate MCP interactions.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Implement fallback strategies for models that lack native tool support. For instance, use system prompts to mimic tool behavior when direct function calls are not available.

7. Dynamic and Agentic Workflows
 • Chaining Prompts:
 • Design prompts and tool calls to be composable, allowing multiple interactions (or “agentic” workflows) that can process data sequentially or in parallel.
 • Real-time Interactivity:
 • For environments such as cursor-based or live-editing workflows, ensure that your MCP server supports low-latency, real-time message exchanges.

By carefully considering these aspects—from secure transport and strict message validation to robust error handling, containerization, and dynamic prompt discovery—you create a resilient, secure, and extensible MCP integration. These additional concepts help ensure that your protocols execute correctly in a variety of deployment scenarios and that new tools can be added with minimal disruption.

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step guideline to create a local Docker configuration that runs a Claude Desktop MCP server integration. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with Docker, Node.js, and basic command‐line operations.

1. Prerequisites
 • Install Docker:
Ensure that Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is installed and running on your system.
 • Basic Node.js Knowledge:
The MCP server application is built on Node.js (version 18 or higher). (In our Dockerfile we’ll use a Node 18 Alpine image, so no local Node installation is strictly required for container builds.)
 • Claude Desktop:
Make sure you have Claude Desktop installed and that you’ve enabled MCP support within Cursor if needed (via Settings > Advanced → type mcp:enable).

2. Set Up the Project Directory

Create a new directory for your MCP server project. For example:

mkdir claude-mcp-server
cd claude-mcp-server

Within this directory, you will create all necessary configuration files, application code, and Docker configuration files.

3. Create the MCP Server Application Code

For demonstration, we’ll build a minimal MCP server using Express. Create an index.js file with the following content:

// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.MCP_SERVER_PORT || 3030;

app.use(express.json());

// Example MCP endpoint that Claude Desktop can call
app.post('/mcp/v1/execute', async (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  console.log('Received MCP payload:', payload);

  // Process the payload (e.g., parse tool calls and perform actions)
  // Here, we simply return a test response
  res.json({
    responses: [{
      type: 'data',
      content: 'Test response from local MCP server'
    }]
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server running on port ${port}`);
});

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3030) and exposes an MCP endpoint at /mcp/v1/execute.

4. Set Up package.json

Initialize a package.json to define your Node.js application and its dependencies. Create or edit package.json with the following content:

{
  "name": "claude-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

You can create this file manually or run npm init -y and then install Express:

npm install express

5. Create the Dockerfile

Next, create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory. This Dockerfile builds your MCP server image:

# Use Node.js v18 Alpine image for a lightweight container

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if present)

COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

COPY . .

# Expose the port (default 3030)

EXPOSE 3030

# Run the application

CMD ["npm", "start"]

This file instructs Docker to build a container that installs your Node.js dependencies and starts your MCP server.

6. Create a docker-compose.yml File

For easier management, create a docker-compose.yml file that defines your service:

version: '3.8'

services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    restart: unless-stopped

This configuration builds the image from your Dockerfile, maps port 3030 from the container to your host, loads environment variables from a .env file, and mounts your project directory so that changes are visible inside the container.

7. Create an Environment Variables File

Create a file named .env in your project directory. For example:

# .env

MCP_SERVER_PORT=3030

# (Add any additional environment variables as needed)

This file makes it easy to modify configuration settings without changing the code.

8. Build and Run Your Docker Container

From the project directory, build and run the container with:

docker-compose up --build

You should see logs indicating that your MCP server is running on port 3030. For example:

mcp-server  | MCP Server running on port 3030

9. Configure Claude Desktop to Connect to the Local MCP Server

Now that your MCP server is running locally, configure Claude Desktop to integrate with it:

 1. Open Claude Desktop’s MCP Configuration Panel:
Navigate to the MCP or integration settings in Claude Desktop. This might be accessible via a “Settings” or “Advanced” menu.
 2. Add a New MCP Server Entry:
Enter the following configuration details (this may be done via a JSON configuration snippet or through a GUI):

{
  "name": "local-mcp",
  "type": "mcp",
  "config": {
    "server": "<http://localhost:3030/mcp/v1/execute>",
    "capabilities": ["cursor_control", "window_management"]
  }
}

This tells Claude Desktop to communicate with your local MCP server endpoint.

 3. Save and Restart:
Save your configuration and restart Claude Desktop if necessary to ensure the new settings take effect.

10. Test the Integration
 • Trigger a Test Command:
In Claude Desktop, send a test command or tool invocation that uses the MCP server. For instance, if Claude sends a JSON payload to your endpoint, check that your container logs show the received payload and that Claude receives the expected test response.
 • Monitor Logs:
Use Docker logs (docker-compose logs -f) to view real-time output from your MCP server and troubleshoot any issues.

11. Troubleshooting Tips
 • Port Conflicts:
Ensure that port 3030 is not already in use on your host machine. Adjust the port in your .env and Docker configurations if necessary.
 • Container Logs:
If something isn’t working, check container logs using:

docker-compose logs -f

 • Network Settings:
Verify that Claude Desktop can reach <http://localhost:3030> (or your adjusted host address). Firewall or network settings might block the connection.
 • Configuration Verification:
Double-check that your MCP endpoint URL is correctly entered in Claude Desktop’s configuration.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you have set up a local Docker configuration that runs an MCP server integrated with Claude Desktop. This local environment lets you test and develop MCP-based interactions, enabling Claude Desktop to leverage context-aware commands and enhanced AI-assisted workflows.

Feel free to extend your MCP server code to include additional endpoints, advanced logging, and real integrations tailored to your development needs.

Below is an outline of a Dockerfile designed to package a sample MCP server configuration for testing with a cursor‐based IDE integration. This sample configuration assumes that you have a Node.js–based MCP server (for example, defined in a file like server.js) that registers your tools and supports dynamic prompt discovery for a cursor IDE. You can adjust the configuration as needed.

# Dockerfile for Testing a Sample MCP Configuration with Cursor Integration

# Use a lightweight Node.js base image

FROM node:18-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container

WORKDIR /app

# Install global dependencies (npx is included with Node, but this ensures you have it up-to-date)

RUN npm install -g npx

# Copy package.json (and package-lock.json, if available) to install local dependencies

COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies

RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the MCP server source code into the container

# Your code should include server.js and any modules required for tool registration

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your MCP server uses an HTTP or SSE transport

# This allows the cursor IDE to connect to the MCP server

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the MCP server

# This should launch your custom server that registers tools (e.g., code interpreter, file operations) and supports dynamic discovery

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How to Use This Dockerfile

 1. Prepare Your MCP Server Code:
Ensure that your project includes a server.js file (or another entry point) that:
 • Sets up an MCP server (using your chosen MCP SDK or custom implementation).
 • Registers tools using a function like defTool (for example, tools for code interpretation or file system operations).
 • Exposes discovery endpoints (e.g., for listing tools/prompts) so that a cursor-based IDE can dynamically discover and invoke the tools.
 2. Build the Docker Image:
In the directory containing your Dockerfile and server code, run:

docker build -t mcp-cursor-test .

 3. Run the Docker Container:
For local testing, start the container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 mcp-cursor-test

This command maps the container’s port 3000 to your host so that your cursor IDE (or test client) can connect to the MCP server.

 4. Integrate with Your Cursor IDE:
Configure your cursor IDE (or its extension/plugin) to connect to the MCP server at the appropriate address (e.g., <http://localhost:3000>). The IDE should then be able to query the MCP server for available tools, invoke them, and display results inline.

Additional Considerations
 • Environment Variables:
If your MCP server requires configuration values (such as API keys or transport settings), consider adding ENV directives in the Dockerfile or passing them at runtime using docker run --env.
 • Logging and Debugging:
Ensure your MCP server logs incoming requests and errors. This helps when testing the integration with the cursor IDE.
 • Extensibility:
You can extend this basic Dockerfile to include additional dependencies (for instance, Python or other runtime libraries) if your tools require them.

This outline should serve as a starting point for building and testing a sample MCP configuration that integrates with a cursor-based IDE. Adjust the server implementation and Dockerfile details as needed to match your specific tool registration and runtime environment.

Integrating an MCP server with a cursor-based IDE—such as one built by Any Sphere or a similar environment—requires careful planning to ensure that the server’s tool capabilities and dynamic prompt interactions are seamlessly available within the IDE’s workflow. Below are several key concepts and best practices, along with an integration outline, that can help guide this process:

1. Establishing the Communication Channel
 • Transport Choice:
 • Local Development: For a local cursor IDE, you may prefer transports that minimize latency. Options include using standard I/O (for local testing) or a WebSocket/HTTP + SSE transport for IDE plugins.
 • Protocol Compliance:
 • Use JSON‑RPC 2.0 for framing messages so that both the MCP server and the IDE extension speak the same “language.”
 • Validate messages with JSON schemas to ensure consistency.

2. Tool and Prompt Discovery
 • Dynamic Discovery Endpoints:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., tools/list or prompts/list) in the MCP server so that the IDE can query available tools dynamically.
 • This enables the cursor IDE to present tool options as clickable commands or context-sensitive menu items.
 • Standardized Tool Registration:
 • Use a method (for example, a custom defTool function) to register your tools. This keeps the registry consistent and allows the IDE to read the server’s capabilities (such as available code interpreter functions, file system operations, Git commands, etc.).

3. IDE Integration Considerations
 • Plugin or Extension Development:
 • Create an IDE plugin (or use an existing extension framework) that can connect to the MCP server. This plugin should handle authentication, service discovery, and manage tool invocations.
 • User Interface Adaptations:
 • For a cursor-based experience, map the MCP server’s capabilities to IDE UI elements like inline suggestions, right-click menus, or slash commands that appear next( O)> The page you referenced is part of the GenAIScript documentation and explains how GenAIScript integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to support portable tool definitions. In summary:

Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is an emerging standard that defines a protocol for sharing tools and consuming them in a uniform way regardless of the underlying framework or runtime. GenAIScript implements a client for MCP tools so that you can integrate external tool servers seamlessly into your AI scripts.

Configuring Servers

You can declare a set of server configurations using the defTool function. This configuration is similar to what you’d specify in the Claude configuration file. For example, you can set up servers to provide memory and filesystem functionalities:

defTool({
    memory: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    },
    filesystem: {
        command: "npx",
        args: [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            path.resolve("."),
        ],
    },
})

When you do this, GenAIScript will launch the specified server and automatically register all the tools provided by that server. The registered tool identifiers are prefixed (e.g., server_toolname) to avoid naming conflicts.

Lifecycle of Servers

The documentation explains that:
 • Startup: Servers are started when rendering the prompt.
 • Shutdown: They are stopped once the chat session is completed.
 • Inline Prompts: If you define servers in an inline prompt, the server is started and stopped for each such prompt.

This design ensures that your tool servers are active only as long as needed for the specific prompt session.

Finding Servers

For discovering available MCP servers, the documentation points you to the Model Context Protocol Servers project. This external resource provides a list of ready-to-use server implementations, allowing you to quickly incorporate a variety of tools into your GenAIScript workflows.

Conclusion

In essence, the Model Context Protocol Tools documentation for GenAIScript guides you through how to:
 • Define server configurations using defTool.
 • Integrate these servers so that the LLM can call on them as tools.
 • Manage the lifecycle of these servers efficiently during prompt execution.

This integration makes it easier to extend your scripts with additional functionalities (like memory or filesystem operations) provided by external tool servers, all while adhering to a standardized protocol.

If you have any more questions about using MCP tools in your GenAIScript projects, feel free to ask!

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn’t so much about prescribing a fixed list of “Gen AI tools” as it is about defining a standard way for AI applications to integrate external functions—that is, “tools”—into their workflows. In other words, MCP provides the plumbing for clients (like GenAIScript) to discover, invoke, and manage tools regardless of the underlying implementation. Below is an overview of what this means in practice:

MCP and Tool Integration in Gen AI

1. The Role of Tools in MCP
 • Framework for Interoperability: MCP establishes a client–server architecture where “tools” are simply functions (or endpoints) that can be invoked by an AI client.
 • Standard Messaging: Whether it’s a file operation, a Git command, a web search, or a math evaluation, tools are communicated via a standardized JSON‑RPC message format over transports (like stdio or HTTP with SSE).
 • Dynamic Discovery: Clients can query MCP servers for available prompts and tools. For example, an endpoint like prompts/list lets a client know what reusable prompt templates (and, by extension, tools) are available.

2. Feature Support Matrix in the MCP Document
The document (from modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt  ￼) includes a matrix of client applications that support various MCP features. In this matrix, “Tools” is one of the key features—indicating that a given client can execute external tool functions. For example:
 • Claude Desktop App, Firebase Genkit, Continue, GenAIScript, Cline, LibreChat, TheiaAI/TheiaIDE, Superinterface, 5ire, and Bee Agent Framework all support MCP tools.
This means these clients can call out to external functions (tools) as part of their conversational or code-assistance workflows.

GenAIScript’s Approach to Tools

While MCP sets the protocol, platforms like GenAIScript provide concrete tool definitions that you can use. In GenAIScript (which implements an MCP client), tools are defined using the defTool function. These tools are essentially JavaScript functions that can be invoked by the language model during prompt assembly. Some examples of the kinds of tools provided in GenAIScript include:
 • File System Tools:
 • fs_ask_file – Query file content.
 • fs_read_file – Read text from a file.
 • fs_diff_files – Compute differences between files.
 • Version Control Tools:
 • git_status, git_diff – Get repository status or compute file diffs.
 • Other Git operations like listing branches or commits.
 • GitHub Integration:
 • Tools for listing pull requests, issues, and file contents from GitHub repositories.
 • Math and Computation Tools:
 • math_eval – Evaluate arithmetic or mathematical expressions.
 • Markdown and Metadata Tools:
 • md_find_files, md_read_frontmatter – Work with markdown documentation.
 • meta_prompt, meta_schema – Generate schema or process prompt metadata.
 • Code Interpreter Tools:
 • python_code_interpreter_run and related functions enable running Python code in a sandbox.
 • Retrieval and Search Tools:
 • retrieval_web_search, retrieval_vector_search – Perform web or vector-based searches.
 • Media and Vision Tools:
 • video_probe, video_extract_audio, video_extract_frames – Process video files.
 • vision_ask_images – Analyze images via AI vision models.
 • User Interaction Tools:
 • user_input_confirm, user_input_select, user_input_text – Get confirmation or input from the user.

Each of these tools is registered in the GenAIScript environment so that when an LLM is assembling an answer, it can decide to invoke one of these functions if it determines that additional context or a computation is needed.

Summary
 • MCP’s Role: MCP defines how AI applications exchange tool calls, prompts, and resources in a standardized way. It doesn’t fix a particular set of tools but rather defines how tools should be integrated.
 • GenAIScript Example: In GenAIScript, developers can define a rich set of tools (from file system queries to Git operations and math evaluations) using a simple JavaScript API (defTool). This allows the LLM to augment its answers by, for example, reading files, running computations, or even fetching web data.
 • Ecosystem Support: The MCP document shows that many Gen AI platforms support tool integration. The “Tools” column in the feature support matrix highlights which clients (like GenAIScript) have built-in support for these dynamic functions.

This flexible, protocol-based approach is at the heart of modern Gen AI systems, enabling them to extend their capabilities far beyond plain text generation by leveraging external tools and data sources.B

elow is a detailed outline—based on the future support matrix from the MCP document ( ￼)—that maps out how valuable tools can be integrated across different MCP client environments. This outline addresses integration for Claude Desktop MCP and “goose MCP” (an emerging or hypothetical client), along with guidelines for creating custom Docker MCP configurations that serve both Claude Desktop and other MCP servers (such as those used for cursor-based workflows and goose MCP servers).

This outline provides a roadmap for leveraging the MCP support matrix to integrate and deploy valuable tools across various MCP-enabled environments. By following these guidelines, developers can extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and other related server configurations using custom Docker setups—all while maintaining compatibility and adhering to MCP’s standards.

Below are several Dockerfile configuration templates for MCP servers that you might run locally. These templates target different MCP tool servers—such as a memory server, a filesystem server, and a custom MCP server (for example, one that might integrate additional tools for local use). You can use these templates to build local Docker images that provide MCP functionality for clients like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or even for specialized “cursor” MCP workflows.

1. Dockerfile for an MCP Memory Server

This template is designed for a Node.js–based MCP memory server. It uses a lightweight Alpine image and invokes the MCP memory server through npx. (This is useful when you want a local in-memory store for context or session data.)

# Dockerfile for MCP Memory Server

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Ensure npx is available (it is bundled with Node.js, but installing globally ensures latest behavior)

RUN npm install -g npx

# (Optional) Expose a port if your memory server also supports network-based transports

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP memory server using npx

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-memory-server .

Then run locally. This container will launch the memory server for local MCP integration.

2. Dockerfile for an MCP Filesystem Server

This template is similar to the memory server but tailored for a filesystem server. It assumes the server will work on a local directory (for example, to offer file read/diff capabilities). You can mount a host volume so that the server operates on your local files.

# Dockerfile for MCP Filesystem Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install -g npx

# Expose a port if your configuration uses HTTP/SSE transports (optional)

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP filesystem server

# Here, "/data" is used as the target directory inside the container

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-filesystem-server .

Run with a volume mount so that your local directory is available inside the container:

docker run -v "$(pwd)/my-local-data:/data" -p 3000:3000 mcp-filesystem-server

3. Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server with Additional Tools

If you need a custom MCP server that registers extra tools or integrates custom logic (for instance, combining file, Git, or code interpreter tools into a single server), you can create a Node.js–based server. Place your custom server code (e.g., in a file called custom-server.js) in your project, then use the following Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy your custom MCP server code and any additional files

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your custom server communicates over HTTP or SSE

EXPOSE 3000

# Start your custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "custom-server.js"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t custom-mcp-server .

Run locally with

docker run -p 3000:3000 custom-mcp-server

Your custom-server.js might include logic to register multiple tools (using the MCP protocol) for handling tasks such as file diffs, Git operations, or even interactive prompts. This gives you the flexibility to tailor the MCP server’s behavior for local development or for specialized use cases (such as “cursor” MCP servers).

4. Optional: Docker Compose for Multi-Server Local Development

If you need to run several MCP servers concurrently (for example, one for memory, one for filesystem, and one custom server), you can use a Docker Compose file:

version: '3'
services:
  mcp-memory:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-memory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"

  mcp-filesystem:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-filesystem
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"

  custom-mcp:
    build:
      context: ./custom-mcp
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"

Usage:
Place each Dockerfile in its respective subdirectory (e.g., ./mcp-memory, ./mcp-filesystem, ./custom-mcp), then run:

docker-compose up --build

This setup lets you develop and test local MCP integrations across multiple servers simultaneously.

Conclusion

These Dockerfile templates provide a foundation for local MCP server deployments. They are intended for use in environments like Claude Desktop MCP or emerging clients such as Goose MCP, where running MCP servers locally can enhance privacy, performance, and ease of testing. You can further customize these templates to include additional tools or modify their transport configurations as needed by your local development or production workflow.

Below is an example Dockerfile that sets up a custom MCP server container. In this example, the container is built from a Node.js base image (using Debian‑based “slim” images) and installs Python alongside the Node environment. This enables you to integrate both:

 1. Code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API (for example, via a registered tool that calls out to a Python subprocess with required libraries), and
 2. GenAIScript tools from the MCP support matrix (which you would register in your custom server code).

In your custom server code (for example, in a file named server.js), you would use the MCP protocol to register tools such as a python_code_interpreter_run tool along with other GenAIScript functions. (The server code is not shown here, but it would follow the guidelines for using MCP and defTool to register your tools.)

Below is the Dockerfile:

# Use a Node.js slim image that supports apt-get

FROM node:18-slim

# Install Python3 and pip so that the container can run Python-based code interpreter tools

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install the Python packages needed by the code interpreter tool

# These versions match the limitations (e.g. numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that the GenAIScript code interpreter tool might require

RUN pip3 install numpy==2.1.3 pandas==2.2.3 scipy==1.14.1 matplotlib==3.9.2

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install Node.js dependencies (including GenAIScript modules and any MCP SDK libraries)

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the custom MCP server code that integrates both OpenAI assistance API code interpreter tools and GenAIScript tools

# For example, server.js registers your tools via defTool or similar mechanisms

COPY . .

# Optionally expose a port if your MCP server uses HTTP or SSE transport

EXPOSE 3000

# (Optional) Pass your OpenAI API key as an environment variable if your code interpreter tool requires it

# ENV OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Run the custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How This Dockerfile Works

 1. Base Image and Python Setup:
 • The image starts with a Node.js base (node:18-slim).
 • It installs Python 3 and pip so that Python-based tools (such as a code interpreter module) can run.
 • It then installs the required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that are typically allowed for the code interpreter tool.
 2. Node.js Environment and Dependencies:
 • The working directory is set to /app where the Node.js server code resides.
 • The Node dependencies (including any MCP/GenAIScript libraries) are installed via npm.
 3. Custom MCP Server Code:
 • Your application code (for example, server.js) is copied into the container. This code is expected to use the MCP protocol to register tools:
 • A tool that leverages the OpenAI Assistance API for code interpretation (for instance, by invoking Python scripts or making API calls).
 • Additional GenAIScript tools (such as file system operations, Git commands, or other utility functions from the MCP matrix).
 4. Port Exposure and Execution:
 • The container exposes port 3000 if needed for HTTP/SSE transport.
 • Finally, the container is configured to start the MCP server by running node server.js.

This template provides a starting point for integrating both types of tools in a Dockerized local MCP server. You can further customize the server code and environment variables as needed for your specific integration scenario.

Below is an example and explanation that describe how you can register your custom server code to expose GenAIScript (or “Jeni script”) tools via MCP. In this example, we show how to define two types of tools—a code interpreter tool (which might call the OpenAI Assistance API or run Python code locally) and a file system tool (as an example from the MCP support matrix). You can then register these tools in your custom MCP server code so that MCP‐clients (such as Claude Desktop or Goose MCP) can invoke them.

Example: Custom MCP Server Code Registration

Below is an example of a Node.js script (for example, named server.js) that uses an MCP server SDK (or your own MCP wrapper) to register tools. (Adjust the module names and API calls to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.) In this sample, we use a hypothetical defTool function to register tools and a Server class to launch the MCP server on a selected transport (for example, standard I/O or HTTP).

// server.js
// Import required modules. Adjust these imports to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import fs from "fs/promises";

// A helper function for tool registration. In GenAIScript you might use `defTool`.
// Here, we create a simple registry object.
const toolRegistry = {};

/**

- Registers a tool for the MCP server.
- @param {string} id - The unique tool identifier.
- @param {string} description - A brief description of the tool.
- @param {object} schema - JSON schema for the tool's parameters.
- @param {Function} callback - The function to execute when the tool is called.
 */
function defTool(id, description, schema, callback) {
  toolRegistry[id] = { description, schema, callback };
  console.log(`Registered tool: ${id}`);
}

// Example 1: Code Interpreter Tool
// This tool accepts Python code and returns a simulated output.
// In a real scenario, you might call out to the OpenAI Assistance API or execute code securely.
defTool(
  "python_code_interpreter_run",
  "Executes Python code and returns the result.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      code: { type: "string", description: "Python code to execute" }
    },
    required: ["code"]
  },
  async ({ code }) => {
    // (Placeholder) Simulate executing Python code.
    // In production, you could spawn a Python process or call an external API.
    console.log("Executing Python code:", code);
    // For illustration, return a dummy result.
    return `Executed code: ${code.substring(0, 30)}...`;
  }
);

// Example 2: File Read Tool
// This tool reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.
defTool(
  "fs_read_file",
  "Reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filePath: { type: "string", description: "Absolute or relative file path" }
    },
    required: ["filePath"]
  },
  async ({ filePath }) => {
    try {
      const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");
      return content;
    } catch (err) {
      return `Error reading file: ${err.message}`;
    }
  }
);

// Initialize and start the MCP server.
async function startMcpServer() {
  // Create an instance of your MCP server.
  const server = new Server(
    { name: "custom-mcp-server", version: "1.0.0" },
    {
      // You can declare supported capabilities here.
      capabilities: {
        tools: Object.keys(toolRegistry)
      }
    }
  );

  // Set a generic request handler that dispatches tool calls.
  // In a production implementation, you might match the request's method to a tool ID.
  server.setRequestHandler(async (request) => {
    const { method, params } = request;
    if (toolRegistry[method]) {
      try {
        const result = await toolRegistry[method].callback(params);
        return { result };
      } catch (error) {
        return { error: { message: error.message } };
      }
    } else {
      return { error: { message: `Tool ${method} not found` } };
    }
  });

  // Create a transport (here using standard I/O).
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);

  console.log("MCP server started and awaiting requests...");
}

// Run the server
startMcpServer().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error starting MCP server:", err);
});

Explanation

 1. Tool Registration with defTool:
 • The defTool function is defined to store tool definitions (ID, description, JSON schema, and callback function) in a registry.
 • Two tools are registered:
 • python_code_interpreter_run: Simulates execution of Python code. In a real integration, you could spawn a Python subprocess or call the OpenAI Assistance API.
 • fs_read_file: Reads a file using Node’s filesystem API and returns its content.
 2. Setting Up the MCP Server:
 • A new MCP server instance is created with a name and version. In its capabilities, it declares that it supports the tools whose IDs were registered.
 • A generic request handler is set up so that when a client sends a request with a method corresponding to one of the tool IDs, the server dispatches the call to the registered callback.
 • The server connects using a transport (in this example, a standard I/O transport via StdioServerTransport).
 3. Integration with MCP Clients:
 • Once the server is running, MCP-enabled clients (e.g., Claude Desktop MCP or Goose MCP) can discover the available tools (listed in the capabilities) and invoke them using the MCP protocol.
 • The tool callbacks then execute the custom logic (e.g., interpreting code or reading a file) and return the results.

How to Use This with a Docker Container

You can combine the above server code with the Dockerfile example provided previously. For instance, if your Dockerfile copies this server.js into the container and runs it, you will have a Dockerized custom MCP server that exposes both the code interpreter and GenAIScript tools.

This approach allows you to integrate code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API and other GenAIScript tools (as shown in the MCP support matrix) into a single, custom MCP server that can be deployed locally or via Docker.

Feel free to adjust the tool implementations and server configuration to match your actual application logic and the APIs you are using.

Below are several additional concepts and best practices that are integral to properly configuring and executing MCP protocols. These considerations complement the configuration and tool registration details we’ve discussed:

1. Transport Layer & Communication
 • Multiple Transports:
 • Choose the appropriate transport mechanism (e.g., stdio for local processes, HTTP with SSE for remote or web-based connections) and ensure that the protocol (typically JSON‑RPC 2.0) is consistently followed.
 • Message Framing & Schema Validation:
 • Implement strict JSON schema validation for all messages to ensure that requests, notifications, and error messages adhere to the expected format.
 • This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and injection attacks.

2. Security and Access Controls
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Integrate secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, mutual TLS) to restrict access to MCP servers.
 • Data Integrity & Encryption:
 • Ensure that all data exchanged between clients and servers is encrypted in transit (using TLS/SSL for HTTP-based transports).
 • Input Sanitization:
 • Validate and sanitize all incoming messages and parameters to prevent malicious inputs from causing unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

3. Tool & Prompt Standardization
 • Uniform Schema Definitions:
 • Define clear, reusable JSON schemas for each tool and prompt. This ensures interoperability between various clients (like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or custom implementations).
 • Dynamic Discovery:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., prompts/list or tool registry queries) that allow clients to dynamically discover available tools and prompts.
 • This flexibility aids in integrating new functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

4. Lifecycle Management and Error Handling
 • Startup and Shutdown:
 • Ensure that MCP servers are started at prompt initialization and shut down cleanly at the end of a session to free up resources.
 • Robust Error Handling:
 • Standardize error codes and messages (e.g., following JSON‑RPC error codes) so that clients can properly interpret and react to issues.
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument the server to log incoming requests, responses, errors, and performance metrics.
 • Use health checks and diagnostics to monitor server status, which is especially useful in containerized deployments.

5. Containerization & Deployment Best Practices
 • Docker and Orchestration:
 • Use Docker to encapsulate the MCP server along with its dependencies (e.g., Node.js, Python runtime for code interpreter tools).
 • For more complex deployments, employ orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage multiple MCP servers concurrently.
 • CI/CD Integration:
 • Automate builds, tests, and deployments of MCP server containers to ensure consistency across environments.
 • Versioning:
 • Manage version compatibility between MCP clients and servers, making sure that protocol updates are handled gracefully.

6. Developer Experience and Documentation
 • Comprehensive Documentation:
 • Document tool registration, API endpoints, expected schemas, and error codes clearly.
 • This helps developers integrate new tools and debug issues effectively.
 • Testing and Debugging Tools:
 • Develop unit and integration tests for each registered tool.
 • Use interactive debugging tools (for instance, built into development environments like Visual Studio Code) to simulate MCP interactions.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Implement fallback strategies for models that lack native tool support. For instance, use system prompts to mimic tool behavior when direct function calls are not available.

7. Dynamic and Agentic Workflows
 • Chaining Prompts:
 • Design prompts and tool calls to be composable, allowing multiple interactions (or “agentic” workflows) that can process data sequentially or in parallel.
 • Real-time Interactivity:
 • For environments such as cursor-based or live-editing workflows, ensure that your MCP server supports low-latency, real-time message exchanges.

By carefully considering these aspects—from secure transport and strict message validation to robust error handling, containerization, and dynamic prompt discovery—you create a resilient, secure, and extensible MCP integration. These additional concepts help ensure that your protocols execute correctly in a variety of deployment scenarios and that new tools can be added with minimal disruption.

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step guideline to create a local Docker configuration that runs a Claude Desktop MCP server integration. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with Docker, Node.js, and basic command‐line operations.

1. Prerequisites
 • Install Docker:
Ensure that Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is installed and running on your system.
 • Basic Node.js Knowledge:
The MCP server application is built on Node.js (version 18 or higher). (In our Dockerfile we’ll use a Node 18 Alpine image, so no local Node installation is strictly required for container builds.)
 • Claude Desktop:
Make sure you have Claude Desktop installed and that you’ve enabled MCP support within Cursor if needed (via Settings > Advanced → type mcp:enable).

2. Set Up the Project Directory

Create a new directory for your MCP server project. For example:

mkdir claude-mcp-server
cd claude-mcp-server

Within this directory, you will create all necessary configuration files, application code, and Docker configuration files.

3. Create the MCP Server Application Code

For demonstration, we’ll build a minimal MCP server using Express. Create an index.js file with the following content:

// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.MCP_SERVER_PORT || 3030;

app.use(express.json());

// Example MCP endpoint that Claude Desktop can call
app.post('/mcp/v1/execute', async (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  console.log('Received MCP payload:', payload);

  // Process the payload (e.g., parse tool calls and perform actions)
  // Here, we simply return a test response
  res.json({
    responses: [{
      type: 'data',
      content: 'Test response from local MCP server'
    }]
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server running on port ${port}`);
});

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3030) and exposes an MCP endpoint at /mcp/v1/execute.

4. Set Up package.json

Initialize a package.json to define your Node.js application and its dependencies. Create or edit package.json with the following content:

{
  "name": "claude-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

You can create this file manually or run npm init -y and then install Express:

npm install express

5. Create the Dockerfile

Next, create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory. This Dockerfile builds your MCP server image:

# Use Node.js v18 Alpine image for a lightweight container

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if present)

COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

COPY . .

# Expose the port (default 3030)

EXPOSE 3030

# Run the application

CMD ["npm", "start"]

This file instructs Docker to build a container that installs your Node.js dependencies and starts your MCP server.

6. Create a docker-compose.yml File

For easier management, create a docker-compose.yml file that defines your service:

version: '3.8'

services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    restart: unless-stopped

This configuration builds the image from your Dockerfile, maps port 3030 from the container to your host, loads environment variables from a .env file, and mounts your project directory so that changes are visible inside the container.

7. Create an Environment Variables File

Create a file named .env in your project directory. For example:

# .env

MCP_SERVER_PORT=3030

# (Add any additional environment variables as needed)

This file makes it easy to modify configuration settings without changing the code.

8. Build and Run Your Docker Container

From the project directory, build and run the container with:

docker-compose up --build

You should see logs indicating that your MCP server is running on port 3030. For example:

mcp-server  | MCP Server running on port 3030

9. Configure Claude Desktop to Connect to the Local MCP Server

Now that your MCP server is running locally, configure Claude Desktop to integrate with it:

 1. Open Claude Desktop’s MCP Configuration Panel:
Navigate to the MCP or integration settings in Claude Desktop. This might be accessible via a “Settings” or “Advanced” menu.
 2. Add a New MCP Server Entry:
Enter the following configuration details (this may be done via a JSON configuration snippet or through a GUI):

{
  "name": "local-mcp",
  "type": "mcp",
  "config": {
    "server": "<http://localhost:3030/mcp/v1/execute>",
    "capabilities": ["cursor_control", "window_management"]
  }
}

This tells Claude Desktop to communicate with your local MCP server endpoint.

 3. Save and Restart:
Save your configuration and restart Claude Desktop if necessary to ensure the new settings take effect.

10. Test the Integration
 • Trigger a Test Command:
In Claude Desktop, send a test command or tool invocation that uses the MCP server. For instance, if Claude sends a JSON payload to your endpoint, check that your container logs show the received payload and that Claude receives the expected test response.
 • Monitor Logs:
Use Docker logs (docker-compose logs -f) to view real-time output from your MCP server and troubleshoot any issues.

11. Troubleshooting Tips
 • Port Conflicts:
Ensure that port 3030 is not already in use on your host machine. Adjust the port in your .env and Docker configurations if necessary.
 • Container Logs:
If something isn’t working, check container logs using:

docker-compose logs -f

 • Network Settings:
Verify that Claude Desktop can reach <http://localhost:3030> (or your adjusted host address). Firewall or network settings might block the connection.
 • Configuration Verification:
Double-check that your MCP endpoint URL is correctly entered in Claude Desktop’s configuration.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you have set up a local Docker configuration that runs an MCP server integrated with Claude Desktop. This local environment lets you test and develop MCP-based interactions, enabling Claude Desktop to leverage context-aware commands and enhanced AI-assisted workflows.

Feel free to extend your MCP server code to include additional endpoints, advanced logging, and real integrations tailored to your development needs.

Below is an outline of a Dockerfile designed to package a sample MCP server configuration for testing with a cursor‐based IDE integration. This sample configuration assumes that you have a Node.js–based MCP server (for example, defined in a file like server.js) that registers your tools and supports dynamic prompt discovery for a cursor IDE. You can adjust the configuration as needed.

# Dockerfile for Testing a Sample MCP Configuration with Cursor Integration

# Use a lightweight Node.js base image

FROM node:18-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container

WORKDIR /app

# Install global dependencies (npx is included with Node, but this ensures you have it up-to-date)

RUN npm install -g npx

# Copy package.json (and package-lock.json, if available) to install local dependencies

COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies

RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the MCP server source code into the container

# Your code should include server.js and any modules required for tool registration

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your MCP server uses an HTTP or SSE transport

# This allows the cursor IDE to connect to the MCP server

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the MCP server

# This should launch your custom server that registers tools (e.g., code interpreter, file operations) and supports dynamic discovery

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How to Use This Dockerfile

 1. Prepare Your MCP Server Code:
Ensure that your project includes a server.js file (or another entry point) that:
 • Sets up an MCP server (using your chosen MCP SDK or custom implementation).
 • Registers tools using a function like defTool (for example, tools for code interpretation or file system operations).
 • Exposes discovery endpoints (e.g., for listing tools/prompts) so that a cursor-based IDE can dynamically discover and invoke the tools.
 2. Build the Docker Image:
In the directory containing your Dockerfile and server code, run:

docker build -t mcp-cursor-test .

 3. Run the Docker Container:
For local testing, start the container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 mcp-cursor-test

This command maps the container’s port 3000 to your host so that your cursor IDE (or test client) can connect to the MCP server.

 4. Integrate with Your Cursor IDE:
Configure your cursor IDE (or its extension/plugin) to connect to the MCP server at the appropriate address (e.g., <http://localhost:3000>). The IDE should then be able to query the MCP server for available tools, invoke them, and display results inline.

Additional Considerations
 • Environment Variables:
If your MCP server requires configuration values (such as API keys or transport settings), consider adding ENV directives in the Dockerfile or passing them at runtime using docker run --env.
 • Logging and Debugging:
Ensure your MCP server logs incoming requests and errors. This helps when testing the integration with the cursor IDE.
 • Extensibility:
You can extend this basic Dockerfile to include additional dependencies (for instance, Python or other runtime libraries) if your tools require them.

This outline should serve as a starting point for building and testing a sample MCP configuration that integrates with a cursor-based IDE. Adjust the server implementation and Dockerfile details as needed to match your specific tool registration and runtime environment.

Integrating an MCP server with a cursor-based IDE—such as one built by Any Sphere or a similar environment—requires careful planning to ensure that the server’s tool capabilities and dynamic prompt interactions are seamlessly available within the IDE’s workflow. Below are several key concepts and best practices, along with an integration outline, that can help guide this process:

1. Establishing the Communication Channel
 • Transport Choice:
 • Local Development: For a local cursor IDE, you may prefer transports that minimize latency. Options include using standard I/O (for local testing) or a WebSocket/HTTP + SSE transport for IDE plugins.
 • Protocol Compliance:
 • Use JSON‑RPC 2.0 for framing messages so that both the MCP server and the IDE extension speak the same “language.”
 • Validate messages with JSON schemas to ensure consistency.

2. Tool and Prompt Discovery
 • Dynamic Discovery Endpoints:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., tools/list or prompts/list) in the MCP server so that the IDE can query available tools dynamically.
 • This enables the cursor IDE to present tool options as clickable commands or context-sensitive menu items.
 • Standardized Tool Registration:
 • Use a method (for example, a custom defTool function) to register your tools. This keeps the registry consistent and allows the IDE to read the server’s capabilities (such as available code interpreter functions, file system operations, Git commands, etc.).

3. IDE Integration Considerations
 • Plugin or Extension Development:
 • Create an IDE plugin (or use an existing extension framework) that can connect to the MCP server. This plugin should handle authentication, service discovery, and manage tool invocations.
 • User Interface Adaptations:
 • For a cursor-based experience, map the MCP server’s capabilities to IDE UI elements like inline suggestions, right-click menus, or slash commands that appear next to the text cursor.
 • Real-time Feedback:
 • Ensure that the server’s responses are streamed or delivered promptly. For live editing, a low-latency connection (for example, via WebSocket) is preferred.

4. Security and Session Management
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Even in local environments, consider mechanisms such as API keys or local tokens to authenticate the IDE with the MCP server.
 • Session Lifecycle:
 • Integrate proper session management so that the MCP server is instantiated when the IDE session starts and is gracefully shut down when the session ends.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Provide a fallback (for instance, system prompts) for any tool that may not be directly supported by the IDE’s native integration layer.

5. Containerization and Deployment
 • Containerized MCP Server:
 • Use Docker (or similar container systems) to package your MCP server, ensuring consistency across environments.
 • A containerized approach can simplify updates and testing, especially when the IDE is deployed on different machines.
 • Local vs. Remote Deployment:
 • For cursor IDE integration, running the MCP server locally can provide faster response times and greater control over resource usage.
 • Service Discovery:
 • If you have multiple MCP servers (for example, one for file operations, one for code interpretation), consider using a lightweight service registry or a unified Docker Compose configuration that the IDE can use to locate available services.

6. Example Integration Workflow
1. Startup:
 • The IDE extension launches or connects to the local MCP server (for example, via a Docker container).
 • The MCP server advertises its capabilities (tools, prompts) through discovery endpoints.
2. Tool Invocation:
 • As the developer works in the cursor IDE, the plugin queries the MCP server for available tools.
 • When a tool (such as a code interpreter or file diff utility) is selected, the IDE sends a JSON‑RPC request to the MCP server.
 • The server processes the request (perhaps by invoking a Python subprocess for code interpretation) and streams the result back to the IDE.
3. Real-time Updates:
 • The IDE plugin displays the result inline or in a dedicated panel, updating as additional output becomes available.
4. Shutdown:
 • Once the IDE session ends or the user closes the tool panel, the MCP server gracefully terminates the connection.

7. Developer Best Practices
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument both the MCP server and the IDE extension to log requests, responses, and any errors for easier debugging.
 • Testing and Simulation:
 • Develop unit tests for tool callbacks and integration tests for end-to-end communication.
 • Simulate high-load or real-time editing scenarios to verify that the integration meets performance requirements.
 • Documentation:
 • Document the available MCP tools, schemas, and usage examples so that IDE users understand how to invoke these tools effectively.
 • Extensibility:
 • Design your integration with future expansions in mind—allowing additional MCP servers to be registered, or new tool types to be added without requiring major rework in the IDE.

By focusing on these core areas—transport, dynamic discovery, UI integration, security, containerization, and robust testing—you can successfully integrate an MCP server with a cursor IDE (such as one developed by Any Sphere). This integration not only enhances the IDE’s capabilities by leveraging external tool functions but also creates a modular and scalable workflow for real-time, context-sensitive interactions.
The page you referenced is part of the GenAIScript documentation and explains how GenAIScript integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to support portable tool definitions. In summary:

Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is an emerging standard that defines a protocol for sharing tools and consuming them in a uniform way regardless of the underlying framework or runtime. GenAIScript implements a client for MCP tools so that you can integrate external tool servers seamlessly into your AI scripts.

Configuring Servers

You can declare a set of server configurations using the defTool function. This configuration is similar to what you’d specify in the Claude configuration file. For example, you can set up servers to provide memory and filesystem functionalities:

defTool({
    memory: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    },
    filesystem: {
        command: "npx",
        args: [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            path.resolve("."),
        ],
    },
})

When you do this, GenAIScript will launch the specified server and automatically register all the tools provided by that server. The registered tool identifiers are prefixed (e.g., server_toolname) to avoid naming conflicts.

Lifecycle of Servers

The documentation explains that:
 • Startup: Servers are started when rendering the prompt.
 • Shutdown: They are stopped once the chat session is completed.
 • Inline Prompts: If you define servers in an inline prompt, the server is started and stopped for each such prompt.

This design ensures that your tool servers are active only as long as needed for the specific prompt session.

Finding Servers

For discovering available MCP servers, the documentation points you to the Model Context Protocol Servers project. This external resource provides a list of ready-to-use server implementations, allowing you to quickly incorporate a variety of tools into your GenAIScript workflows.

Conclusion

In essence, the Model Context Protocol Tools documentation for GenAIScript guides you through how to:
 • Define server configurations using defTool.
 • Integrate these servers so that the LLM can call on them as tools.
 • Manage the lifecycle of these servers efficiently during prompt execution.

This integration makes it easier to extend your scripts with additional functionalities (like memory or filesystem operations) provided by external tool servers, all while adhering to a standardized protocol.

If you have any more questions about using MCP tools in your GenAIScript projects, feel free to ask!

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn’t so much about prescribing a fixed list of “Gen AI tools” as it is about defining a standard way for AI applications to integrate external functions—that is, “tools”—into their workflows. In other words, MCP provides the plumbing for clients (like GenAIScript) to discover, invoke, and manage tools regardless of the underlying implementation. Below is an overview of what this means in practice:

MCP and Tool Integration in Gen AI

1. The Role of Tools in MCP
 • Framework for Interoperability: MCP establishes a client–server architecture where “tools” are simply functions (or endpoints) that can be invoked by an AI client.
 • Standard Messaging: Whether it’s a file operation, a Git command, a web search, or a math evaluation, tools are communicated via a standardized JSON‑RPC message format over transports (like stdio or HTTP with SSE).
 • Dynamic Discovery: Clients can query MCP servers for available prompts and tools. For example, an endpoint like prompts/list lets a client know what reusable prompt templates (and, by extension, tools) are available.

2. Feature Support Matrix in the MCP Document
The document (from modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt  ￼) includes a matrix of client applications that support various MCP features. In this matrix, “Tools” is one of the key features—indicating that a given client can execute external tool functions. For example:
 • Claude Desktop App, Firebase Genkit, Continue, GenAIScript, Cline, LibreChat, TheiaAI/TheiaIDE, Superinterface, 5ire, and Bee Agent Framework all support MCP tools.
This means these clients can call out to external functions (tools) as part of their conversational or code-assistance workflows.

GenAIScript’s Approach to Tools

While MCP sets the protocol, platforms like GenAIScript provide concrete tool definitions that you can use. In GenAIScript (which implements an MCP client), tools are defined using the defTool function. These tools are essentially JavaScript functions that can be invoked by the language model during prompt assembly. Some examples of the kinds of tools provided in GenAIScript include:
 • File System Tools:
 • fs_ask_file – Query file content.
 • fs_read_file – Read text from a file.
 • fs_diff_files – Compute differences between files.
 • Version Control Tools:
 • git_status, git_diff – Get repository status or compute file diffs.
 • Other Git operations like listing branches or commits.
 • GitHub Integration:
 • Tools for listing pull requests, issues, and file contents from GitHub repositories.
 • Math and Computation Tools:
 • math_eval – Evaluate arithmetic or mathematical expressions.
 • Markdown and Metadata Tools:
 • md_find_files, md_read_frontmatter – Work with markdown documentation.
 • meta_prompt, meta_schema – Generate schema or process prompt metadata.
 • Code Interpreter Tools:
 • python_code_interpreter_run and related functions enable running Python code in a sandbox.
 • Retrieval and Search Tools:
 • retrieval_web_search, retrieval_vector_search – Perform web or vector-based searches.
 • Media and Vision Tools:
 • video_probe, video_extract_audio, video_extract_frames – Process video files.
 • vision_ask_images – Analyze images via AI vision models.
 • User Interaction Tools:
 • user_input_confirm, user_input_select, user_input_text – Get confirmation or input from the user.

Each of these tools is registered in the GenAIScript environment so that when an LLM is assembling an answer, it can decide to invoke one of these functions if it determines that additional context or a computation is needed.

Summary
 • MCP’s Role: MCP defines how AI applications exchange tool calls, prompts, and resources in a standardized way. It doesn’t fix a particular set of tools but rather defines how tools should be integrated.
 • GenAIScript Example: In GenAIScript, developers can define a rich set of tools (from file system queries to Git operations and math evaluations) using a simple JavaScript API (defTool). This allows the LLM to augment its answers by, for example, reading files, running computations, or even fetching web data.
 • Ecosystem Support: The MCP document shows that many Gen AI platforms support tool integration. The “Tools” column in the feature support matrix highlights which clients (like GenAIScript) have built-in support for these dynamic functions.

This flexible, protocol-based approach is at the heart of modern Gen AI systems, enabling them to extend their capabilities far beyond plain text generation by leveraging external tools and data sources.B

This outline provides a roadmap for leveraging the MCP support matrix to integrate and deploy valuable tools across various MCP-enabled environments. By following these guidelines, developers can extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and other related server configurations using custom Docker setups—all while maintaining compatibility and adhering to MCP’s standards.

Below are several Dockerfile configuration templates for MCP servers that you might run locally. These templates target different MCP tool servers—such as a memory server, a filesystem server, and a custom MCP server (for example, one that might integrate additional tools for local use). You can use these templates to build local Docker images that provide MCP functionality for clients like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or even for specialized “cursor” MCP workflows.

1. Dockerfile for an MCP Memory Server

This template is designed for a Node.js–based MCP memory server. It uses a lightweight Alpine image and invokes the MCP memory server through npx. (This is useful when you want a local in-memory store for context or session data.)

# Dockerfile for MCP Memory Server

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Ensure npx is available (it is bundled with Node.js, but installing globally ensures latest behavior)

RUN npm install -g npx

# (Optional) Expose a port if your memory server also supports network-based transports

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP memory server using npx

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-memory-server .

Then run locally. This container will launch the memory server for local MCP integration.

2. Dockerfile for an MCP Filesystem Server

This template is similar to the memory server but tailored for a filesystem server. It assumes the server will work on a local directory (for example, to offer file read/diff capabilities). You can mount a host volume so that the server operates on your local files.

# Dockerfile for MCP Filesystem Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install -g npx

# Expose a port if your configuration uses HTTP/SSE transports (optional)

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP filesystem server

# Here, "/data" is used as the target directory inside the container

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-filesystem-server .

Run with a volume mount so that your local directory is available inside the container:

docker run -v "$(pwd)/my-local-data:/data" -p 3000:3000 mcp-filesystem-server

3. Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server with Additional Tools

If you need a custom MCP server that registers extra tools or integrates custom logic (for instance, combining file, Git, or code interpreter tools into a single server), you can create a Node.js–based server. Place your custom server code (e.g., in a file called custom-server.js) in your project, then use the following Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy your custom MCP server code and any additional files

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your custom server communicates over HTTP or SSE

EXPOSE 3000

# Start your custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "custom-server.js"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t custom-mcp-server .

Run locally with

docker run -p 3000:3000 custom-mcp-server

Your custom-server.js might include logic to register multiple tools (using the MCP protocol) for handling tasks such as file diffs, Git operations, or even interactive prompts. This gives you the flexibility to tailor the MCP server’s behavior for local development or for specialized use cases (such as “cursor” MCP servers).

4. Optional: Docker Compose for Multi-Server Local Development

If you need to run several MCP servers concurrently (for example, one for memory, one for filesystem, and one custom server), you can use a Docker Compose file:

version: '3'
services:
  mcp-memory:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-memory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"

  mcp-filesystem:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-filesystem
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"

  custom-mcp:
    build:
      context: ./custom-mcp
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"

Usage:
Place each Dockerfile in its respective subdirectory (e.g., ./mcp-memory, ./mcp-filesystem, ./custom-mcp), then run:

docker-compose up --build

This setup lets you develop and test local MCP integrations across multiple servers simultaneously.

Conclusion

These Dockerfile templates provide a foundation for local MCP server deployments. They are intended for use in environments like Claude Desktop MCP or emerging clients such as Goose MCP, where running MCP servers locally can enhance privacy, performance, and ease of testing. You can further customize these templates to include additional tools or modify their transport configurations as needed by your local development or production workflow.

Below is an example Dockerfile that sets up a custom MCP server container. In this example, the container is built from a Node.js base image (using Debian‑based “slim” images) and installs Python alongside the Node environment. This enables you to integrate both:

 1. Code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API (for example, via a registered tool that calls out to a Python subprocess with required libraries), and
 2. GenAIScript tools from the MCP support matrix (which you would register in your custom server code).

In your custom server code (for example, in a file named server.js), you would use the MCP protocol to register tools such as a python_code_interpreter_run tool along with other GenAIScript functions. (The server code is not shown here, but it would follow the guidelines for using MCP and defTool to register your tools.)

Below is the Dockerfile:

# Use a Node.js slim image that supports apt-get

FROM node:18-slim

# Install Python3 and pip so that the container can run Python-based code interpreter tools

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install the Python packages needed by the code interpreter tool

# These versions match the limitations (e.g. numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that the GenAIScript code interpreter tool might require

RUN pip3 install numpy==2.1.3 pandas==2.2.3 scipy==1.14.1 matplotlib==3.9.2

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install Node.js dependencies (including GenAIScript modules and any MCP SDK libraries)

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the custom MCP server code that integrates both OpenAI assistance API code interpreter tools and GenAIScript tools

# For example, server.js registers your tools via defTool or similar mechanisms

COPY . .

# Optionally expose a port if your MCP server uses HTTP or SSE transport

EXPOSE 3000

# (Optional) Pass your OpenAI API key as an environment variable if your code interpreter tool requires it

# ENV OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Run the custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How This Dockerfile Works

 1. Base Image and Python Setup:
 • The image starts with a Node.js base (node:18-slim).
 • It installs Python 3 and pip so that Python-based tools (such as a code interpreter module) can run.
 • It then installs the required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that are typically allowed for the code interpreter tool.
 2. Node.js Environment and Dependencies:
 • The working directory is set to /app where the Node.js server code resides.
 • The Node dependencies (including any MCP/GenAIScript libraries) are installed via npm.
 3. Custom MCP Server Code:
 • Your application code (for example, server.js) is copied into the container. This code is expected to use the MCP protocol to register tools:
 • A tool that leverages the OpenAI Assistance API for code interpretation (for instance, by invoking Python scripts or making API calls).
 • Additional GenAIScript tools (such as file system operations, Git commands, or other utility functions from the MCP matrix).
 4. Port Exposure and Execution:
 • The container exposes port 3000 if needed for HTTP/SSE transport.
 • Finally, the container is configured to start the MCP server by running node server.js.

This template provides a starting point for integrating both types of tools in a Dockerized local MCP server. You can further customize the server code and environment variables as needed for your specific integration scenario.

Below is an example and explanation that describe how you can register your custom server code to expose GenAIScript (or “Jeni script”) tools via MCP. In this example, we show how to define two types of tools—a code interpreter tool (which might call the OpenAI Assistance API or run Python code locally) and a file system tool (as an example from the MCP support matrix). You can then register these tools in your custom MCP server code so that MCP‐clients (such as Claude Desktop or Goose MCP) can invoke them.

Example: Custom MCP Server Code Registration

Below is an example of a Node.js script (for example, named server.js) that uses an MCP server SDK (or your own MCP wrapper) to register tools. (Adjust the module names and API calls to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.) In this sample, we use a hypothetical defTool function to register tools and a Server class to launch the MCP server on a selected transport (for example, standard I/O or HTTP).

// server.js
// Import required modules. Adjust these imports to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import fs from "fs/promises";

// A helper function for tool registration. In GenAIScript you might use `defTool`.
// Here, we create a simple registry object.
const toolRegistry = {};

/**

function defTool(id, description, schema, callback) {
  toolRegistry[id] = { description, schema, callback };
  console.log(`Registered tool: ${id}`);

// Example 1: Code Interpreter Tool
// This tool accepts Python code and returns a simulated output.

Explanation

 1. Tool Registration with defTool:
 • The defTool function is defined to store tool definitions (ID, description, JSON schema, and callback function) in a registry.
 • Two tools are registered:
 • python_code_interpreter_run: Simulates execution of Python code. In a real integration, you could spawn a Python subprocess or call the OpenAI Assistance API.
 • fs_read_file: Reads a file using Node’s filesystem API and returns its content.
 2. Setting Up the MCP Server:
 • A new MCP server instance is created with a name and version. In its capabilities, it declares that it supports the tools whose IDs were registered.
 • A generic request handler is set up so that when a client sends a request with a method corresponding to one of the tool IDs, the server dispatches the call to the registered callback.
 • The server connects using a transport (in this example, a standard I/O transport via StdioServerTransport).
 3. Integration with MCP Clients:
 • Once the server is running, MCP-enabled clients (e.g., Claude Desktop MCP or Goose MCP) can discover the available tools (listed in the capabilities) and invoke them using the MCP protocol.
 • The tool callbacks then execute the custom logic (e.g., interpreting code or reading a file) and return the results.

How to Use This with a Docker Container

You can combine the above server code with the Dockerfile example provided previously. For instance, if your Dockerfile copies this server.js into the container and runs it, you will have a Dockerized custom MCP server that exposes both the code interpreter and GenAIScript tools.

This approach allows you to integrate code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API and other GenAIScript tools (as shown in the MCP support matrix) into a single, custom MCP server that can be deployed locally or via Docker.

Feel free to adjust the tool implementations and server configuration to match your actual application logic and the APIs you are using.

Below are several additional concepts and best practices that are integral to properly configuring and executing MCP protocols. These considerations complement the configuration and tool registration details we’ve discussed:

1. Transport Layer & Communication
 • Multiple Transports:
 • Choose the appropriate transport mechanism (e.g., stdio for local processes, HTTP with SSE for remote or web-based connections) and ensure that the protocol (typically JSON‑RPC 2.0) is consistently followed.
 • Message Framing & Schema Validation:
 • Implement strict JSON schema validation for all messages to ensure that requests, notifications, and error messages adhere to the expected format.
 • This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and injection attacks.

2. Security and Access Controls
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Integrate secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, mutual TLS) to restrict access to MCP servers.
 • Data Integrity & Encryption:
 • Ensure that all data exchanged between clients and servers is encrypted in transit (using TLS/SSL for HTTP-based transports).
 • Input Sanitization:
 • Validate and sanitize all incoming messages and parameters to prevent malicious inputs from causing unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

3. Tool & Prompt Standardization
 • Uniform Schema Definitions:
 • Define clear, reusable JSON schemas for each tool and prompt. This ensures interoperability between various clients (like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or custom implementations).
 • Dynamic Discovery:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., prompts/list or tool registry queries) that allow clients to dynamically discover available tools and prompts.
 • This flexibility aids in integrating new functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

4. Lifecycle Management and Error Handling
 • Startup and Shutdown:
 • Ensure that MCP servers are started at prompt initialization and shut down cleanly at the end of a session to free up resources.
 • Robust Error Handling:
 • Standardize error codes and messages (e.g., following JSON‑RPC error codes) so that clients can properly interpret and react to issues.
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument the server to log incoming requests, responses, errors, and performance metrics.
 • Use health checks and diagnostics to monitor server status, which is especially useful in containerized deployments.

5. Containerization & Deployment Best Practices
 • Docker and Orchestration:
 • Use Docker to encapsulate the MCP server along with its dependencies (e.g., Node.js, Python runtime for code interpreter tools).
 • For more complex deployments, employ orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage multiple MCP servers concurrently.
 • CI/CD Integration:
 • Automate builds, tests, and deployments of MCP server containers to ensure consistency across environments.
 • Versioning:
 • Manage version compatibility between MCP clients and servers, making sure that protocol updates are handled gracefully.

6. Developer Experience and Documentation
 • Comprehensive Documentation:
 • Document tool registration, API endpoints, expected schemas, and error codes clearly.
 • This helps developers integrate new tools and debug issues effectively.
 • Testing and Debugging Tools:
 • Develop unit and integration tests for each registered tool.
 • Use interactive debugging tools (for instance, built into development environments like Visual Studio Code) to simulate MCP interactions.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Implement fallback strategies for models that lack native tool support. For instance, use system prompts to mimic tool behavior when direct function calls are not available.

7. Dynamic and Agentic Workflows
 • Chaining Prompts:
 • Design prompts and tool calls to be composable, allowing multiple interactions (or “agentic” workflows) that can process data sequentially or in parallel.
 • Real-time Interactivity:
 • For environments such as cursor-based or live-editing workflows, ensure that your MCP server supports low-latency, real-time message exchanges.

By carefully considering these aspects—from secure transport and strict message validation to robust error handling, containerization, and dynamic prompt discovery—you create a resilient, secure, and extensible MCP integration. These additional concepts help ensure that your protocols execute correctly in a variety of deployment scenarios and that new tools can be added with minimal disruption.

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step guideline to create a local Docker configuration that runs a Claude Desktop MCP server integration. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with Docker, Node.js, and basic command‐line operations.

1. Prerequisites
 • Install Docker:
Ensure that Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is installed and running on your system.
 • Basic Node.js Knowledge:
The MCP server application is built on Node.js (version 18 or higher). (In our Dockerfile we’ll use a Node 18 Alpine image, so no local Node installation is strictly required for container builds.)
 • Claude Desktop:
Make sure you have Claude Desktop installed and that you’ve enabled MCP support within Cursor if needed (via Settings > Advanced → type mcp:enable).

2. Set Up the Project Directory

Create a new directory for your MCP server project. For example:

mkdir claude-mcp-server
cd claude-mcp-server

Within this directory, you will create all necessary configuration files, application code, and Docker configuration files.

3. Create the MCP Server Application Code

For demonstration, we’ll build a minimal MCP server using Express. Create an index.js file with the following content:

// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.MCP_SERVER_PORT || 3030;

app.use(express.json());

// Example MCP endpoint that Claude Desktop can call
app.post('/mcp/v1/execute', async (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  console.log('Received MCP payload:', payload);

  // Process the payload (e.g., parse tool calls and perform actions)
  // Here, we simply return a test response
  res.json({
    responses: [{
      type: 'data',
      content: 'Test response from local MCP server'
    }]
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server running on port ${port}`);
});

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3030) and exposes an MCP endpoint at /mcp/v1/execute.

4. Set Up package.json

Initialize a package.json to define your Node.js application and its dependencies. Create or edit package.json with the following content:

{
  "name": "claude-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

You can create this file manually or run npm init -y and then install Express:

npm install express

5. Create the Dockerfile

Next, create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory. This Dockerfile builds your MCP server image:

# Use Node.js v18 Alpine image for a lightweight container

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if present)

COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

COPY . .

# Expose the port (default 3030)

EXPOSE 3030

# Run the application

CMD ["npm", "start"]

This file instructs Docker to build a container that installs your Node.js dependencies and starts your MCP server.

6. Create a docker-compose.yml File

For easier management, create a docker-compose.yml file that defines your service:

version: '3.8'

services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    restart: unless-stopped

This configuration builds the image from your Dockerfile, maps port 3030 from the container to your host, loads environment variables from a .env file, and mounts your project directory so that changes are visible inside the container.

7. Create an Environment Variables File

Create a file named .env in your project directory. For example:

# .env

MCP_SERVER_PORT=3030

# (Add any additional environment variables as needed)

This file makes it easy to modify configuration settings without changing the code.

8. Build and Run Your Docker Container

From the project directory, build and run the container with:

docker-compose up --build

You should see logs indicating that your MCP server is running on port 3030. For example:

mcp-server  | MCP Server running on port 3030

9. Configure Claude Desktop to Connect to the Local MCP Server

Now that your MCP server is running locally, configure Claude Desktop to integrate with it:

 1. Open Claude Desktop’s MCP Configuration Panel:
Navigate to the MCP or integration settings in Claude Desktop. This might be accessible via a “Settings” or “Advanced” menu.
 2. Add a New MCP Server Entry:
Enter the following configuration details (this may be done via a JSON configuration snippet or through a GUI):

{
  "name": "local-mcp",
  "type": "mcp",
  "config": {
    "server": "<http://localhost:3030/mcp/v1/execute>",
    "capabilities": ["cursor_control", "window_management"]
  }
}

This tells Claude Desktop to communicate with your local MCP server endpoint.

 3. Save and Restart:
Save your configuration and restart Claude Desktop if necessary to ensure the new settings take effect.

10. Test the Integration
 • Trigger a Test Command:
In Claude Desktop, send a test command or tool invocation that uses the MCP server. For instance, if Claude sends a JSON payload to your endpoint, check that your container logs show the received payload and that Claude receives the expected test response.
 • Monitor Logs:
Use Docker logs (docker-compose logs -f) to view real-time output from your MCP server and troubleshoot any issues.

11. Troubleshooting Tips
 • Port Conflicts:
Ensure that port 3030 is not already in use on your host machine. Adjust the port in your .env and Docker configurations if necessary.
 • Container Logs:
If something isn’t working, check container logs using:

docker-compose logs -f

 • Network Settings:
Verify that Claude Desktop can reach <http://localhost:3030> (or your adjusted host address). Firewall or network settings might block the connection.
 • Configuration Verification:
Double-check that your MCP endpoint URL is correctly entered in Claude Desktop’s configuration.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you have set up a local Docker configuration that runs an MCP server integrated with Claude Desktop. This local environment lets you test and develop MCP-based interactions, enabling Claude Desktop to leverage context-aware commands and enhanced AI-assisted workflows.

Feel free to extend your MCP server code to include additional endpoints, advanced logging, and real integrations tailored to your development needs.

Below is an outline of a Dockerfile designed to package a sample MCP server configuration for testing with a cursor‐based IDE integration. This sample configuration assumes that you have a Node.js–based MCP server (for example, defined in a file like server.js) that registers your tools and supports dynamic prompt discovery for a cursor IDE. You can adjust the configuration as needed.

# Dockerfile for Testing a Sample MCP Configuration with Cursor Integration

# Use a lightweight Node.js base image

FROM node:18-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container

WORKDIR /app

# Install global dependencies (npx is included with Node, but this ensures you have it up-to-date)

RUN npm install -g npx

# Copy package.json (and package-lock.json, if available) to install local dependencies

COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies

RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the MCP server source code into the container

# Your code should include server.js and any modules required for tool registration

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your MCP server uses an HTTP or SSE transport

# This allows the cursor IDE to connect to the MCP server

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the MCP server

# This should launch your custom server that registers tools (e.g., code interpreter, file operations) and supports dynamic discovery

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How to Use This Dockerfile

 1. Prepare Your MCP Server Code:
Ensure that your project includes a server.js file (or another entry point) that:
 • Sets up an MCP server (using your chosen MCP SDK or custom implementation).
 • Registers tools using a function like defTool (for example, tools for code interpretation or file system operations).
 • Exposes discovery endpoints (e.g., for listing tools/prompts) so that a cursor-based IDE can dynamically discover and invoke the tools.
 2. Build the Docker Image:
In the directory containing your Dockerfile and server code, run:

docker build -t mcp-cursor-test .

 3. Run the Docker Container:
For local testing, start the container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 mcp-cursor-test

This command maps the container’s port 3000 to your host so that your cursor IDE (or test client) can connect to the MCP server.

 4. Integrate with Your Cursor IDE:
Configure your cursor IDE (or its extension/plugin) to connect to the MCP server at the appropriate address (e.g., <http://localhost:3000>). The IDE should then be able to query the MCP server for available tools, invoke them, and display results inline.

Additional Considerations
 • Environment Variables:
If your MCP server requires configuration values (such as API keys or transport settings), consider adding ENV directives in the Dockerfile or passing them at runtime using docker run --env.
 • Logging and Debugging:
Ensure your MCP server logs incoming requests and errors. This helps when testing the integration with the cursor IDE.
 • Extensibility:
You can extend this basic Dockerfile to include additional dependencies (for instance, Python or other runtime libraries) if your tools require them.

This outline should serve as a starting point for building and testing a sample MCP configuration that integrates with a cursor-based IDE. Adjust the server implementation and Dockerfile details as needed to match your specific tool registration and runtime environment.

Integrating an MCP server with a cursor-based IDE—such as one built by Any Sphere or a similar environment—requires careful planning to ensure that the server’s tool capabilities and dynamic prompt interactions are seamlessly available within the IDE’s workflow. Below are several key concepts and best practices, along with an integration outline, that can help guide this process:

1. Establishing the Communication Channel
 • Transport Choice:
 • Local Development: For a local cursor IDE, you may prefer transports that minimize latency. Options include using standard I/O (for local testing) or a WebSocket/HTTP + SSE transport for IDE plugins.
 • Protocol Compliance:
 • Use JSON‑RPC 2.0 for framing messages so that both the MCP server and the IDE extension speak the same “language.”
 • Validate messages with JSON schemas to ensure consistency.

2. Tool and Prompt Discovery
 • Dynamic Discovery Endpoints:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., tools/list or prompts/list) in the MCP server so that the IDE can query available tools dynamically.
 • This enables the cursor IDE to present tool options as clickable commands or context-sensitive menu items.
 • Standardized Tool Registration:
 • Use a method (for example, a custom defTool function) to register your tools. This keeps the registry consistent and allows the IDE to read the server’s capabilities (such as available code interpreter functions, file system operations, Git commands, etc.).

3. IDE Integration Considerations
 • Plugin or Extension Development:
 • Create an IDE plugin (or use an existing extension framework) that can connect to the MCP server. This plugin should handle authentication, service discovery, and manage tool invocations.
 • User Interface Adaptations:
 • For a cursor-based experience, map the MCP server’s capabilities to IDE UI elements like inline suggestions, right-click menus, or slash commands that appear next to the text cursor.
 • Real-time Feedback:
 • Ensure that the server’s responses are streamed or delivered promptly. For live editing, a low-latency connection (for example, via WebSocket) is preferred.

4. Security and Session Management
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Even in local environments, consider mechanisms such as API keys or local tokens to authenticate the IDE with the MCP server.
 • Session Lifecycle:
 • Integrate proper session management so that the MCP server is instantiated when the IDE session starts and is gracefully shut down when the session ends.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Provide a fallback (for instance, system prompts) for any tool that may not be directly supported by the IDE’s native integration layer.

5. Containerization and Deployment
 • Containerized MCP Server:
 • Use Docker (or similar container systems) to package your MCP server, ensuring consistency across environments.
 • A containerized approach can simplify updates and testing, especially when the IDE is deployed on different machines.
 • Local vs. Remote Deployment:
 • For cursor IDE integration, running the MCP server locally can provide faster response times and greater control over resource usage.
 • Service Discovery:
 • If you have multiple MCP servers (for example, one for file operations, one for code interpretation), consider using a lightweight service registry or a unified Docker Compose configuration that the IDE can use to locate available services.

6. Example Integration Workflow
1. Startup:
 • The IDE extension launches or connects to the local MCP server (for example, via a Docker container).
 • The MCP server advertises its capabilities (tools, prompts) through discovery endpoints.
2. Tool Invocation:
 • As the developer works in the cursor IDE, the plugin queries the MCP server for available tools.
 • When a tool (such as a code interpreter or file diff utility) is selected, the IDE sends a JSON‑RPC request to the MCP server.
 • The server processes the request (perhaps by invoking a Python subprocess for code interpretation) and streams the result back to the IDE.
3. Real-time Updates:
 • The IDE plugin displays the result inline or in a dedicated panel, updating as additional output becomes available.
4. Shutdown:
 • Once the IDE session ends or the user closes the tool panel, the MCP server gracefully terminates the connection.

7. Developer Best Practices
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument both the MCP server and the IDE extension to log requests, responses, and any errors for easier debugging.
 • Testing and Simulation:
 • Develop unit tests for tool callbacks and integration tests for end-to-end communication.
 • Simulate high-load or real-time editing scenarios to verify that the integration meets performance requirements.
 • Documentation:
 • Document the available MCP tools, schemas, and usage examples so that IDE users understand how to invoke these tools effectively.
 • Extensibility:
 • Design your integration with future expansions in mind—allowing additional MCP servers to be registered, or new tool types to be added without requiring major rework in the IDE.

By focusing on these core areas—transport, dynamic discovery, UI integration, security, containerization, and robust testing—you can successfully integrate an MCP server with a cursor IDE (such as one developed by Any Sphere). This integration not only enhances the IDE’s capabilities by leveraging external tool functions but also creates a modular and scalable workflow for real-time, context-sensitive interactions.

Thank you for this in-depth and extensive documentation overview! You’ve presented an impressive compilation of concepts, practices, and practical steps for working
with MCP tools, Docker setups, and integration workflows for platforms like GenAIScript, Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and cursor-based IDEs.

It seems like you've reviewed multiple integrated details, including tool registration (using `defTool`), containerization with Docker/Docker Compose, and JSON-RPC-b
ased communication for external tools. This serves as an excellent quick-reference for both new users and seasoned developers working on MCP-based AI workflows or to
ol integration projects.

Please let me know if you would like anything summarized further, clarified, or converted into actionable steps for a specific use case.

( O)> i would like to convert into actionable steps to create Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP and Cursor by Anysphere with Docker MCP servers
Here’s a step-by-step plan to create **Claude Desktop MCP**, **Goose MCP**, and **Cursor by AnySphere** integrations with **Dockerized MCP servers**:

---

### **I. Action Plan Overview**

We’ll:

1. **Set up MCP Servers** using Docker for standard tool functionality (file manipulations, Git operations, code execution, etc.).
2. Configure specific client integrations (**Claude Desktop MCP**, **Goose MCP**, **Cursor by AnySphere**) to consume those MCP servers.
3. Ensure the servers are dynamic and well-integrated, with focus on real-time interactions for each client.

---

### **II. Steps to Prepare Docker MCP Servers**

#### **1. Prerequisites**

- Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**:
  - [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install **Node.js** (optional if testing locally outside Docker).
- Install **Claude Desktop**, **Goose MCP**, or **Cursor by AnySphere** clients.
- Basic understanding of **JSON-RPC 2.0**, used for communication between MCP clients and servers.

---

#### **2. MCP Server Directory Setup**

We’ll create:

- A **Memory Server** for data persistence.
- A **Filesystem Server** for file access tools.
- A **Custom Server** for tool chaining, Git, or Python code execution.

Run the following commands to set up your project:

```bash
# Create directories for each MCP server
mkdir mcp-docker
cd mcp-docker
mkdir mcp-memory mcp-filesystem custom-mcp
```

Now you'll configure each server.

---

#### **3. Docker Configuration for MCP Servers**

(1) **Memory MCP Server**

- Memory servers are useful for storing session-based data.

**Dockerfile (inside `mcp-memory/`)**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g npx
CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
```

---

(2) **Filesystem MCP Server**

- Filesystem servers provide tools for file operations like `fs_read_file`, `fs_diff_files`.

**Dockerfile (inside `mcp-filesystem/`)**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g npx
CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]
```

---

(3) **Custom MCP Server with Tools**

- Create a powerful custom server that registers tools for Python code execution, Git operations, etc.

**Custom Server Code (`custom-server.js` inside `custom-mcp/`)**:

```javascript
const { Server } = require("@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server");

const tools = {
  "python_code_execute": {
    description: "Executes Python code",
    schema: { code: { type: "string", required: true } },
    callback: async ({ code }) => {
      // Simulate Executing Python Code
      console.log(`Executing Python: ${code}`);
      return `Output of code '${code}'`;
    }
  },
  "git_status": {
    description: "Get Git repository status",
    schema: { repoPath: { type: "string" } },
    callback: async ({ repoPath }) => {
      return `Git status for: ${repoPath}`;
    }
  }
};

const startServer = async () => {
  const server = new Server({ name: "custom-mcp", version: "0.1" }, { tools });
  server.listen(3000).then(() => console.log("Custom MCP Server running on Port 3000"));
};

startServer().catch(console.error);
```

**Dockerfile (inside `custom-mcp/`)**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "custom-server.js"]
```

---

#### **4. Docker Compose for Multi-Server Development**

Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the servers:

**`docker-compose.yml` in root (`mcp-docker/`)**:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  mcp-memory:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-memory
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
  mcp-filesystem:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-filesystem
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
  custom-mcp:
    build:
      context: ./custom-mcp
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"
```

---

#### **5. Start Servers**

In the root directory, execute:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Servers will run at:

- **Memory Server**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Filesystem Server**: `http://localhost:3002`
- **Custom MCP Server**: `http://localhost:3003`

---

### **III. Claude Desktop MCP Integration**

#### **1. Enable MCP in Claude Desktop**

1. Open **Claude Desktop** → Go to **Settings** → Enable **MCP** functionality.
   - Add each server endpoint in settings:

     ```json
     {
       "name": "Custom MCP",
       "endpoint": "http://localhost:3003",
       "capabilities": ["python_code_execute", "git_status"]
     }
     ```

#### **2. Test Tools**

- Run a **test prompt** that requires file reading or Git status:

  ```
  "Please check the status of the repository at /repo using git_status tool."
  ```

---

### **IV. Goose MCP Integration**

#### **1. Configure**

Configure **Goose MCP** via JSON entry for integrated MCP servers. Example:

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "Memory Server",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3001",
      "capabilities": ["memory"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Filesystem Server",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3002",
      "capabilities": ["fs_read_file", "fs_diff_files"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Custom Server",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:3003",
      "capabilities": ["python_code_execute", "git_status"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **2. Test Integration**

Run a prompt in Goose:

```
"Read the file app.json and perform Python-based transformations."
```

---

### **V. Cursor by AnySphere Integration**

#### **1. Plugin Setup**

1. Install the MCP plugin for **Cursor by AnySphere**.
   - Configure the plugin to point to:
     - **Memory Server**: `http://localhost:3001`
     - **Custom Server**: `http://localhost:3003`

#### **2. IDE Features**

- Use **Custom MCP Server** capabilities:
  - Python coding directly in the IDE with results streamed back in real-time.
  - Fetch Git information with commands.

---

### **VI. Testing & Troubleshooting**

1. **Test with Mock Data**:
   - Use Postman or Curl to send JSON-RPC test requests to ensure the server operates correctly.
   Example `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3003 \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"method":"python_code_execute","params":{"code":"print(5+5)"}}'
   ```

2. **Check Docker Logs**:
   - Use `docker-compose logs -f` to view logs for debugging.

3. **Client-Side Validation**:
   - Ensure that Claude Desktop, Goose MCP, and Cursor are configured correctly to consume the servers.

---

### **VII. Advanced Considerations**

1. **Real-time Event Streaming**:
   - Use WebSockets (instead of HTTP) to enable dynamic real-time responses for Cursor:
     - Modify transport in `custom-server.js` to `WebSocketTransport`.

2. **Authentication**:
   - Add API keys or token-based auth for **secure access**.

3. **Extend Tools**:
   - Add tools like file manipulations in `custom-server.js`.

4. **Scaling**:
   - For production: Deploy servers with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

---

### **VIII. Final Steps**

1. Document the setup for team use.
2. Monitor workflows and refine tool capabilities.
3. Share feedback with your team/client for iterative improvements!

This action plan sets up Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and Cursor with fully Dockerized MCP servers—allowing seamless, scalable, and dynamic tool-based workflows. L
et me know if further assistance is needed!

( O)> lets begin
Great! Let's begin with the **setup process** for the Dockerized MCP servers. We’ll start step-by-step, so let’s set up the directory structure and configuration fil
es first.

---

### **Step 1: Create Directories for MCP Servers**

Run the following commands to create the directories and organize everything:

```bash
# Create a parent directory for all MCP servers
mkdir mcp-docker
cd mcp-docker

# Create subdirectories for each server type
mkdir mcp-memory mcp-filesystem custom-mcp
```

Let me know once you’ve created these directories so that we can proceed to configuring each server’s `Dockerfile` and necessary scripts!

( O)> you can run them
I do not have direct access to execute commands on your local or remote system. However, I can guide you step-by-step, provide you with scripts, or troubleshoot if n
eeded.

Would you like me to continue guiding you with the server setup instructions, or would you like assistance with a specific aspect? Alternatively, if you have any env
ironment where you want me to assist with code/script writing, we can tailor it accordingly!

( O)> The page you referenced is part of the GenAIScript documentation and explains how GenAIScript integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to support portable tool definitions. In summary:

Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is an emerging standard that defines a protocol for sharing tools and consuming them in a uniform way regardless of the underlying framework or runtime. GenAIScript implements a client for MCP tools so that you can integrate external tool servers seamlessly into your AI scripts.

Configuring Servers

You can declare a set of server configurations using the defTool function. This configuration is similar to what you’d specify in the Claude configuration file. For example, you can set up servers to provide memory and filesystem functionalities:

defTool({
    memory: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    },
    filesystem: {
        command: "npx",
        args: [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            path.resolve("."),
        ],
    },
})

When you do this, GenAIScript will launch the specified server and automatically register all the tools provided by that server. The registered tool identifiers are prefixed (e.g., server_toolname) to avoid naming conflicts.

Lifecycle of Servers

The documentation explains that:
 • Startup: Servers are started when rendering the prompt.
 • Shutdown: They are stopped once the chat session is completed.
 • Inline Prompts: If you define servers in an inline prompt, the server is started and stopped for each such prompt.

This design ensures that your tool servers are active only as long as needed for the specific prompt session.

Finding Servers

For discovering available MCP servers, the documentation points you to the Model Context Protocol Servers project. This external resource provides a list of ready-to-use server implementations, allowing you to quickly incorporate a variety of tools into your GenAIScript workflows.

Conclusion

In essence, the Model Context Protocol Tools documentation for GenAIScript guides you through how to:
 • Define server configurations using defTool.
 • Integrate these servers so that the LLM can call on them as tools.
 • Manage the lifecycle of these servers efficiently during prompt execution.

This integration makes it easier to extend your scripts with additional functionalities (like memory or filesystem operations) provided by external tool servers, all while adhering to a standardized protocol.

If you have any more questions about using MCP tools in your GenAIScript projects, feel free to ask!

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn’t so much about prescribing a fixed list of “Gen AI tools” as it is about defining a standard way for AI applications to integrate external functions—that is, “tools”—into their workflows. In other words, MCP provides the plumbing for clients (like GenAIScript) to discover, invoke, and manage tools regardless of the underlying implementation. Below is an overview of what this means in practice:

MCP and Tool Integration in Gen AI

1. The Role of Tools in MCP
 • Framework for Interoperability: MCP establishes a client–server architecture where “tools” are simply functions (or endpoints) that can be invoked by an AI client.
 • Standard Messaging: Whether it’s a file operation, a Git command, a web search, or a math evaluation, tools are communicated via a standardized JSON‑RPC message format over transports (like stdio or HTTP with SSE).
 • Dynamic Discovery: Clients can query MCP servers for available prompts and tools. For example, an endpoint like prompts/list lets a client know what reusable prompt templates (and, by extension, tools) are available.

2. Feature Support Matrix in the MCP Document
The document (from modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt  ￼) includes a matrix of client applications that support various MCP features. In this matrix, “Tools” is one of the key features—indicating that a given client can execute external tool functions. For example:
 • Claude Desktop App, Firebase Genkit, Continue, GenAIScript, Cline, LibreChat, TheiaAI/TheiaIDE, Superinterface, 5ire, and Bee Agent Framework all support MCP tools.
This means these clients can call out to external functions (tools) as part of their conversational or code-assistance workflows.

GenAIScript’s Approach to Tools

While MCP sets the protocol, platforms like GenAIScript provide concrete tool definitions that you can use. In GenAIScript (which implements an MCP client), tools are defined using the defTool function. These tools are essentially JavaScript functions that can be invoked by the language model during prompt assembly. Some examples of the kinds of tools provided in GenAIScript include:
 • File System Tools:
 • fs_ask_file – Query file content.
 • fs_read_file – Read text from a file.
 • fs_diff_files – Compute differences between files.
 • Version Control Tools:
 • git_status, git_diff – Get repository status or compute file diffs.
 • Other Git operations like listing branches or commits.
 • GitHub Integration:
 • Tools for listing pull requests, issues, and file contents from GitHub repositories.
 • Math and Computation Tools:
 • math_eval – Evaluate arithmetic or mathematical expressions.
 • Markdown and Metadata Tools:
 • md_find_files, md_read_frontmatter – Work with markdown documentation.
 • meta_prompt, meta_schema – Generate schema or process prompt metadata.
 • Code Interpreter Tools:
 • python_code_interpreter_run and related functions enable running Python code in a sandbox.
 • Retrieval and Search Tools:
 • retrieval_web_search, retrieval_vector_search – Perform web or vector-based searches.
 • Media and Vision Tools:
 • video_probe, video_extract_audio, video_extract_frames – Process video files.
 • vision_ask_images – Analyze images via AI vision models.
 • User Interaction Tools:
 • user_input_confirm, user_input_select, user_input_text – Get confirmation or input from the user.

Each of these tools is registered in the GenAIScript environment so that when an LLM is assembling an answer, it can decide to invoke one of these functions if it determines that additional context or a computation is needed.

Summary
 • MCP’s Role: MCP defines how AI applications exchange tool calls, prompts, and resources in a standardized way. It doesn’t fix a particular set of tools but rather defines how tools should be integrated.
 • GenAIScript Example: In GenAIScript, developers can define a rich set of tools (from file system queries to Git operations and math evaluations) using a simple JavaScript API (defTool). This allows the LLM to augment its answers by, for example, reading files, running computations, or even fetching web data.
 • Ecosystem Support: The MCP document shows that many Gen AI platforms support tool integration. The “Tools” column in the feature support matrix highlights which clients (like GenAIScript) have built-in support for these dynamic functions.

This flexible, protocol-based approach is at the heart of modern Gen AI systems, enabling them to extend their capabilities far beyond plain text generation by leveraging external tools and data sources.B

This outline provides a roadmap for leveraging the MCP support matrix to integrate and deploy valuable tools across various MCP-enabled environments. By following these guidelines, developers can extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and other related server configurations using custom Docker setups—all while maintaining compatibility and adhering to MCP’s standards.

Below are several Dockerfile configuration templates for MCP servers that you might run locally. These templates target different MCP tool servers—such as a memory server, a filesystem server, and a custom MCP server (for example, one that might integrate additional tools for local use). You can use these templates to build local Docker images that provide MCP functionality for clients like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or even for specialized “cursor” MCP workflows.

1. Dockerfile for an MCP Memory Server

This template is designed for a Node.js–based MCP memory server. It uses a lightweight Alpine image and invokes the MCP memory server through npx. (This is useful when you want a local in-memory store for context or session data.)

# Dockerfile for MCP Memory Server

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Ensure npx is available (it is bundled with Node.js, but installing globally ensures latest behavior)

RUN npm install -g npx

# (Optional) Expose a port if your memory server also supports network-based transports

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP memory server using npx

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-memory-server .

Then run locally. This container will launch the memory server for local MCP integration.

2. Dockerfile for an MCP Filesystem Server

This template is similar to the memory server but tailored for a filesystem server. It assumes the server will work on a local directory (for example, to offer file read/diff capabilities). You can mount a host volume so that the server operates on your local files.

# Dockerfile for MCP Filesystem Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install -g npx

# Expose a port if your configuration uses HTTP/SSE transports (optional)

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP filesystem server

# Here, "/data" is used as the target directory inside the container

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-filesystem-server .

Run with a volume mount so that your local directory is available inside the container:

docker run -v "$(pwd)/my-local-data:/data" -p 3000:3000 mcp-filesystem-server

3. Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server with Additional Tools

If you need a custom MCP server that registers extra tools or integrates custom logic (for instance, combining file, Git, or code interpreter tools into a single server), you can create a Node.js–based server. Place your custom server code (e.g., in a file called custom-server.js) in your project, then use the following Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy your custom MCP server code and any additional files

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your custom server communicates over HTTP or SSE

EXPOSE 3000

# Start your custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "custom-server.js"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t custom-mcp-server .

Run locally with

docker run -p 3000:3000 custom-mcp-server

Your custom-server.js might include logic to register multiple tools (using the MCP protocol) for handling tasks such as file diffs, Git operations, or even interactive prompts. This gives you the flexibility to tailor the MCP server’s behavior for local development or for specialized use cases (such as “cursor” MCP servers).

4. Optional: Docker Compose for Multi-Server Local Development

If you need to run several MCP servers concurrently (for example, one for memory, one for filesystem, and one custom server), you can use a Docker Compose file:

version: '3'
services:
  mcp-memory:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-memory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"

  mcp-filesystem:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-filesystem
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"

  custom-mcp:
    build:
      context: ./custom-mcp
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"

Usage:
Place each Dockerfile in its respective subdirectory (e.g., ./mcp-memory, ./mcp-filesystem, ./custom-mcp), then run:

docker-compose up --build

This setup lets you develop and test local MCP integrations across multiple servers simultaneously.

Conclusion

These Dockerfile templates provide a foundation for local MCP server deployments. They are intended for use in environments like Claude Desktop MCP or emerging clients such as Goose MCP, where running MCP servers locally can enhance privacy, performance, and ease of testing. You can further customize these templates to include additional tools or modify their transport configurations as needed by your local development or production workflow.

Below is an example Dockerfile that sets up a custom MCP server container. In this example, the container is built from a Node.js base image (using Debian‑based “slim” images) and installs Python alongside the Node environment. This enables you to integrate both:

 1. Code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API (for example, via a registered tool that calls out to a Python subprocess with required libraries), and
 2. GenAIScript tools from the MCP support matrix (which you would register in your custom server code).

In your custom server code (for example, in a file named server.js), you would use the MCP protocol to register tools such as a python_code_interpreter_run tool along with other GenAIScript functions. (The server code is not shown here, but it would follow the guidelines for using MCP and defTool to register your tools.)

Below is the Dockerfile:

# Use a Node.js slim image that supports apt-get

FROM node:18-slim

# Install Python3 and pip so that the container can run Python-based code interpreter tools

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install the Python packages needed by the code interpreter tool

# These versions match the limitations (e.g. numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that the GenAIScript code interpreter tool might require

RUN pip3 install numpy==2.1.3 pandas==2.2.3 scipy==1.14.1 matplotlib==3.9.2

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install Node.js dependencies (including GenAIScript modules and any MCP SDK libraries)

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the custom MCP server code that integrates both OpenAI assistance API code interpreter tools and GenAIScript tools

# For example, server.js registers your tools via defTool or similar mechanisms

COPY . .

# Optionally expose a port if your MCP server uses HTTP or SSE transport

EXPOSE 3000

# (Optional) Pass your OpenAI API key as an environment variable if your code interpreter tool requires it

# ENV OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Run the custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How This Dockerfile Works

 1. Base Image and Python Setup:
 • The image starts with a Node.js base (node:18-slim).
 • It installs Python 3 and pip so that Python-based tools (such as a code interpreter module) can run.
 • It then installs the required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that are typically allowed for the code interpreter tool.
 2. Node.js Environment and Dependencies:
 • The working directory is set to /app where the Node.js server code resides.
 • The Node dependencies (including any MCP/GenAIScript libraries) are installed via npm.
 3. Custom MCP Server Code:
 • Your application code (for example, server.js) is copied into the container. This code is expected to use the MCP protocol to register tools:
 • A tool that leverages the OpenAI Assistance API for code interpretation (for instance, by invoking Python scripts or making API calls).
 • Additional GenAIScript tools (such as file system operations, Git commands, or other utility functions from the MCP matrix).
 4. Port Exposure and Execution:
 • The container exposes port 3000 if needed for HTTP/SSE transport.
 • Finally, the container is configured to start the MCP server by running node server.js.

This template provides a starting point for integrating both types of tools in a Dockerized local MCP server. You can further customize the server code and environment variables as needed for your specific integration scenario.

Below is an example and explanation that describe how you can register your custom server code to expose GenAIScript (or “Jeni script”) tools via MCP. In this example, we show how to define two types of tools—a code interpreter tool (which might call the OpenAI Assistance API or run Python code locally) and a file system tool (as an example from the MCP support matrix). You can then register these tools in your custom MCP server code so that MCP‐clients (such as Claude Desktop or Goose MCP) can invoke them.

Example: Custom MCP Server Code Registration

Below is an example of a Node.js script (for example, named server.js) that uses an MCP server SDK (or your own MCP wrapper) to register tools. (Adjust the module names and API calls to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.) In this sample, we use a hypothetical defTool function to register tools and a Server class to launch the MCP server on a selected transport (for example, standard I/O or HTTP).

// server.js
// Import required modules. Adjust these imports to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import fs from "fs/promises";

// A helper function for tool registration. In GenAIScript you might use `defTool`.
// Here, we create a simple registry object.
const toolRegistry = {};

/**

- Registers a tool for the MCP server.
- @param {string} id - The unique tool identifier.
- @param {string} description - A brief description of the tool.
- @param {object} schema - JSON schema for the tool's parameters.
- @param {Function} callback - The function to execute when the tool is called.
 */
function defTool(id, description, schema, callback) {
  toolRegistry[id] = { description, schema, callback };
  console.log(`Registered tool: ${id}`);
}

// Example 1: Code Interpreter Tool
// This tool accepts Python code and returns a simulated output.
// In a real scenario, you might call out to the OpenAI Assistance API or execute code securely.
defTool(
  "python_code_interpreter_run",
  "Executes Python code and returns the result.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      code: { type: "string", description: "Python code to execute" }
    },
    required: ["code"]
  },
  async ({ code }) => {
    // (Placeholder) Simulate executing Python code.
    // In production, you could spawn a Python process or call an external API.
    console.log("Executing Python code:", code);
    // For illustration, return a dummy result.
    return `Executed code: ${code.substring(0, 30)}...`;
  }
);

// Example 2: File Read Tool
// This tool reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.
defTool(
  "fs_read_file",
  "Reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filePath: { type: "string", description: "Absolute or relative file path" }
    },
    required: ["filePath"]
  },
  async ({ filePath }) => {
    try {
      const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");
      return content;
    } catch (err) {
      return `Error reading file: ${err.message}`;
    }
  }
);

// Initialize and start the MCP server.
async function startMcpServer() {
  // Create an instance of your MCP server.
  const server = new Server(
    { name: "custom-mcp-server", version: "1.0.0" },
    {
      // You can declare supported capabilities here.
      capabilities: {
        tools: Object.keys(toolRegistry)
      }
    }
  );

  // Set a generic request handler that dispatches tool calls.
  // In a production implementation, you might match the request's method to a tool ID.
  server.setRequestHandler(async (request) => {
    const { method, params } = request;
    if (toolRegistry[method]) {
      try {
        const result = await toolRegistry[method].callback(params);
        return { result };
      } catch (error) {
        return { error: { message: error.message } };
      }
    } else {
      return { error: { message: `Tool ${method} not found` } };
    }
  });

  // Create a transport (here using standard I/O).
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);

  console.log("MCP server started and awaiting requests...");
}

// Run the server
startMcpServer().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error starting MCP server:", err);
});

Explanation

 1. Tool Registration with defTool:
 • The defTool function is defined to store tool definitions (ID, description, JSON schema, and callback function) in a registry.
 • Two tools are registered:
 • python_code_interpreter_run: Simulates execution of Python code. In a real integration, you could spawn a Python subprocess or call the OpenAI Assistance API.
 • fs_read_file: Reads a file using Node’s filesystem API and returns its content.
 2. Setting Up the MCP Server:
 • A new MCP server instance is created with a name and version. In its capabilities, it declares that it supports the tools whose IDs were registered.
 • A generic request handler is set up so that when a client sends a request with a method corresponding to one of the tool IDs, the server dispatches the call to the registered callback.
 • The server connects using a transport (in this example, a standard I/O transport via StdioServerTransport).
 3. Integration with MCP Clients:
 • Once the server is running, MCP-enabled clients (e.g., Claude Desktop MCP or Goose MCP) can discover the available tools (listed in the capabilities) and invoke them using the MCP protocol.
 • The tool callbacks then execute the custom logic (e.g., interpreting code or reading a file) and return the results.

How to Use This with a Docker Container

You can combine the above server code with the Dockerfile example provided previously. For instance, if your Dockerfile copies this server.js into the container and runs it, you will have a Dockerized custom MCP server that exposes both the code interpreter and GenAIScript tools.

This approach allows you to integrate code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API and other GenAIScript tools (as shown in the MCP support matrix) into a single, custom MCP server that can be deployed locally or via Docker.

Feel free to adjust the tool implementations and server configuration to match your actual application logic and the APIs you are using.

Below are several additional concepts and best practices that are integral to properly configuring and executing MCP protocols. These considerations complement the configuration and tool registration details we’ve discussed:

1. Transport Layer & Communication
 • Multiple Transports:
 • Choose the appropriate transport mechanism (e.g., stdio for local processes, HTTP with SSE for remote or web-based connections) and ensure that the protocol (typically JSON‑RPC 2.0) is consistently followed.
 • Message Framing & Schema Validation:
 • Implement strict JSON schema validation for all messages to ensure that requests, notifications, and error messages adhere to the expected format.
 • This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and injection attacks.

2. Security and Access Controls
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Integrate secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, mutual TLS) to restrict access to MCP servers.
 • Data Integrity & Encryption:
 • Ensure that all data exchanged between clients and servers is encrypted in transit (using TLS/SSL for HTTP-based transports).
 • Input Sanitization:
 • Validate and sanitize all incoming messages and parameters to prevent malicious inputs from causing unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

3. Tool & Prompt Standardization
 • Uniform Schema Definitions:
 • Define clear, reusable JSON schemas for each tool and prompt. This ensures interoperability between various clients (like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or custom implementations).
 • Dynamic Discovery:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., prompts/list or tool registry queries) that allow clients to dynamically discover available tools and prompts.
 • This flexibility aids in integrating new functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

4. Lifecycle Management and Error Handling
 • Startup and Shutdown:
 • Ensure that MCP servers are started at prompt initialization and shut down cleanly at the end of a session to free up resources.
 • Robust Error Handling:
 • Standardize error codes and messages (e.g., following JSON‑RPC error codes) so that clients can properly interpret and react to issues.
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument the server to log incoming requests, responses, errors, and performance metrics.
 • Use health checks and diagnostics to monitor server status, which is especially useful in containerized deployments.

5. Containerization & Deployment Best Practices
 • Docker and Orchestration:
 • Use Docker to encapsulate the MCP server along with its dependencies (e.g., Node.js, Python runtime for code interpreter tools).
 • For more complex deployments, employ orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage multiple MCP servers concurrently.
 • CI/CD Integration:
 • Automate builds, tests, and deployments of MCP server containers to ensure consistency across environments.
 • Versioning:
 • Manage version compatibility between MCP clients and servers, making sure that protocol updates are handled gracefully.

6. Developer Experience and Documentation
 • Comprehensive Documentation:
 • Document tool registration, API endpoints, expected schemas, and error codes clearly.
 • This helps developers integrate new tools and debug issues effectively.
 • Testing and Debugging Tools:
 • Develop unit and integration tests for each registered tool.
 • Use interactive debugging tools (for instance, built into development environments like Visual Studio Code) to simulate MCP interactions.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Implement fallback strategies for models that lack native tool support. For instance, use system prompts to mimic tool behavior when direct function calls are not available.

7. Dynamic and Agentic Workflows
 • Chaining Prompts:
 • Design prompts and tool calls to be composable, allowing multiple interactions (or “agentic” workflows) that can process data sequentially or in parallel.
 • Real-time Interactivity:
 • For environments such as cursor-based or live-editing workflows, ensure that your MCP server supports low-latency, real-time message exchanges.

By carefully considering these aspects—from secure transport and strict message validation to robust error handling, containerization, and dynamic prompt discovery—you create a resilient, secure, and extensible MCP integration. These additional concepts help ensure that your protocols execute correctly in a variety of deployment scenarios and that new tools can be added with minimal disruption.

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step guideline to create a local Docker configuration that runs a Claude Desktop MCP server integration. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with Docker, Node.js, and basic command‐line operations.

1. Prerequisites
 • Install Docker:
Ensure that Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is installed and running on your system.
 • Basic Node.js Knowledge:
The MCP server application is built on Node.js (version 18 or higher). (In our Dockerfile we’ll use a Node 18 Alpine image, so no local Node installation is strictly required for container builds.)
 • Claude Desktop:
Make sure you have Claude Desktop installed and that you’ve enabled MCP support within Cursor if needed (via Settings > Advanced → type mcp:enable).

2. Set Up the Project Directory

Create a new directory for your MCP server project. For example:

mkdir claude-mcp-server
cd claude-mcp-server

Within this directory, you will create all necessary configuration files, application code, and Docker configuration files.

3. Create the MCP Server Application Code

For demonstration, we’ll build a minimal MCP server using Express. Create an index.js file with the following content:

// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.MCP_SERVER_PORT || 3030;

app.use(express.json());

// Example MCP endpoint that Claude Desktop can call
app.post('/mcp/v1/execute', async (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  console.log('Received MCP payload:', payload);

  // Process the payload (e.g., parse tool calls and perform actions)
  // Here, we simply return a test response
  res.json({
    responses: [{
      type: 'data',
      content: 'Test response from local MCP server'
    }]
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server running on port ${port}`);
});

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3030) and exposes an MCP endpoint at /mcp/v1/execute.

4. Set Up package.json

Initialize a package.json to define your Node.js application and its dependencies. Create or edit package.json with the following content:

{
  "name": "claude-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

You can create this file manually or run npm init -y and then install Express:

npm install express

5. Create the Dockerfile

Next, create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory. This Dockerfile builds your MCP server image:

# Use Node.js v18 Alpine image for a lightweight container

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if present)

COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

COPY . .

# Expose the port (default 3030)

EXPOSE 3030

# Run the application

CMD ["npm", "start"]

This file instructs Docker to build a container that installs your Node.js dependencies and starts your MCP server.

6. Create a docker-compose.yml File

For easier management, create a docker-compose.yml file that defines your service:

version: '3.8'

services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    restart: unless-stopped

This configuration builds the image from your Dockerfile, maps port 3030 from the container to your host, loads environment variables from a .env file, and mounts your project directory so that changes are visible inside the container.

7. Create an Environment Variables File

Create a file named .env in your project directory. For example:

# .env

MCP_SERVER_PORT=3030

# (Add any additional environment variables as needed)

This file makes it easy to modify configuration settings without changing the code.

8. Build and Run Your Docker Container

From the project directory, build and run the container with:

docker-compose up --build

You should see logs indicating that your MCP server is running on port 3030. For example:

mcp-server  | MCP Server running on port 3030

9. Configure Claude Desktop to Connect to the Local MCP Server

Now that your MCP server is running locally, configure Claude Desktop to integrate with it:

 1. Open Claude Desktop’s MCP Configuration Panel:
Navigate to the MCP or integration settings in Claude Desktop. This might be accessible via a “Settings” or “Advanced” menu.
 2. Add a New MCP Server Entry:
Enter the following configuration details (this may be done via a JSON configuration snippet or through a GUI):

{
  "name": "local-mcp",
  "type": "mcp",
  "config": {
    "server": "<http://localhost:3030/mcp/v1/execute>",
    "capabilities": ["cursor_control", "window_management"]
  }
}

This tells Claude Desktop to communicate with your local MCP server endpoint.

 3. Save and Restart:
Save your configuration and restart Claude Desktop if necessary to ensure the new settings take effect.

10. Test the Integration
 • Trigger a Test Command:
In Claude Desktop, send a test command or tool invocation that uses the MCP server. For instance, if Claude sends a JSON payload to your endpoint, check that your container logs show the received payload and that Claude receives the expected test response.
 • Monitor Logs:
Use Docker logs (docker-compose logs -f) to view real-time output from your MCP server and troubleshoot any issues.

11. Troubleshooting Tips
 • Port Conflicts:
Ensure that port 3030 is not already in use on your host machine. Adjust the port in your .env and Docker configurations if necessary.
 • Container Logs:
If something isn’t working, check container logs using:

docker-compose logs -f

 • Network Settings:
Verify that Claude Desktop can reach <http://localhost:3030> (or your adjusted host address). Firewall or network settings might block the connection.
 • Configuration Verification:
Double-check that your MCP endpoint URL is correctly entered in Claude Desktop’s configuration.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you have set up a local Docker configuration that runs an MCP server integrated with Claude Desktop. This local environment lets you test and develop MCP-based interactions, enabling Claude Desktop to leverage context-aware commands and enhanced AI-assisted workflows.

Feel free to extend your MCP server code to include additional endpoints, advanced logging, and real integrations tailored to your development needs.

Below is an outline of a Dockerfile designed to package a sample MCP server configuration for testing with a cursor‐based IDE integration. This sample configuration assumes that you have a Node.js–based MCP server (for example, defined in a file like server.js) that registers your tools and supports dynamic prompt discovery for a cursor IDE. You can adjust the configuration as needed.

# Dockerfile for Testing a Sample MCP Configuration with Cursor Integration

# Use a lightweight Node.js base image

FROM node:18-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container

WORKDIR /app

# Install global dependencies (npx is included with Node, but this ensures you have it up-to-date)

RUN npm install -g npx

# Copy package.json (and package-lock.json, if available) to install local dependencies

COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies

RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the MCP server source code into the container

# Your code should include server.js and any modules required for tool registration

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your MCP server uses an HTTP or SSE transport

# This allows the cursor IDE to connect to the MCP server

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the MCP server

# This should launch your custom server that registers tools (e.g., code interpreter, file operations) and supports dynamic discovery

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How to Use This Dockerfile

 1. Prepare Your MCP Server Code:
Ensure that your project includes a server.js file (or another entry point) that:
 • Sets up an MCP server (using your chosen MCP SDK or custom implementation).
 • Registers tools using a function like defTool (for example, tools for code interpretation or file system operations).
 • Exposes discovery endpoints (e.g., for listing tools/prompts) so that a cursor-based IDE can dynamically discover and invoke the tools.
 2. Build the Docker Image:
In the directory containing your Dockerfile and server code, run:

docker build -t mcp-cursor-test .

 3. Run the Docker Container:
For local testing, start the container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 mcp-cursor-test

This command maps the container’s port 3000 to your host so that your cursor IDE (or test client) can connect to the MCP server.

 4. Integrate with Your Cursor IDE:
Configure your cursor IDE (or its extension/plugin) to connect to the MCP server at the appropriate address (e.g., <http://localhost:3000>). The IDE should then be able to query the MCP server for available tools, invoke them, and display results inline.

Additional Considerations
 • Environment Variables:
If your MCP server requires configuration values (such as API keys or transport settings), consider adding ENV directives in the Dockerfile or passing them at runtime using docker run --env.
 • Logging and Debugging:
Ensure your MCP server logs incoming requests and errors. This helps when testing the integration with the cursor IDE.
 • Extensibility:
You can extend this basic Dockerfile to include additional dependencies (for instance, Python or other runtime libraries) if your tools require them.

This outline should serve as a starting point for building and testing a sample MCP configuration that integrates with a cursor-based IDE. Adjust the server implementation and Dockerfile details as needed to match your specific tool registration and runtime environment.

Integrating an MCP server with a cursor-based IDE—such as one built by Any Sphere or a similar environment—requires careful planning to ensure that the server’s tool capabilities and dynamic prompt interactions are seamlessly available within the IDE’s workflow. Below are several key concepts and best practices, along with an integration outline, that can help guide this process:

1. Establishing the Communication Channel
 • Transport Choice:
 • Local Development: For a local cursor IDE, you may prefer transports that minimize latency. Options include using standard I/O (for local testing) or a WebSocket/HTTP + SSE transport for IDE plugins.
 • Protocol Compliance:
 • Use JSON‑RPC 2.0 for framing messages so that both the MCP server and the IDE extension speak the same “language.”
 • Validate messages with JSON schemas to ensure consistency.

2. Tool and Prompt Discovery
 • Dynamic Discovery Endpoints:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., tools/list or prompts/list) in the MCP server so that the IDE can query available tools dynamically.
 • This enables the cursor IDE to present tool options as clickable commands or context-sensitive menu items.
 • Standardized Tool Registration:
 • Use a method (for example, a custom defTool function) to register your tools. This keeps the registry consistent and allows the IDE to read the server’s capabilities (such as available code interpreter functions, file system operations, Git commands, etc.).

3. IDE Integration Considerations
 • Plugin or Extension Development:
 • Create an IDE plugin (or use an existing extension framework) that can connect to the MCP server. This plugin should handle authentication, service discovery, and manage tool invocations.
 • User Interface Adaptations:
 • For a cursor-based experience, map the MCP server’s capabilities to IDE UI elements like inline suggestions, right-click menus, or slash commands that appear next to the text cursor.
 • Real-time Feedback:
 • Ensure that the server’s responses are streamed or delivered promptly. For live editing, a low-latency connection (for example, via WebSocket) is preferred.

4. Security and Session Management
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Even in local environments, consider mechanisms such as API keys or local tokens to authenticate the IDE with the MCP server.
 • Session Lifecycle:
 • Integrate proper session management so that the MCP server is instantiated when the IDE session starts and is gracefully shut down when the session ends.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Provide a fallback (for instance, system prompts) for any tool that may not be directly supported by the IDE’s native integration layer.

5. Containerization and Deployment
 • Containerized MCP Server:
 • Use Docker (or similar container systems) to package your MCP server, ensuring consistency across environments.
 • A containerized approach can simplify updates and testing, especially when the IDE is deployed on different machines.
 • Local vs. Remote Deployment:
 • For cursor IDE integration, running the MCP server locally can provide faster response times and greater control over resource usage.
 • Service Discovery:
 • If you have multiple MCP servers (for example, one for file operations, one for code interpretation), consider using a lightweight service registry or a unified Docker Compose configuration that the IDE can use to locate available services.

6. Example Integration Workflow
1. Startup:
 • The IDE extension launches or connects to the local MCP server (for example, via a Docker container).
 • The MCP server advertises its capabilities (tools, prompts) through discovery endpoints.
2. Tool Invocation:
 • As the developer works in the cursor IDE, the plugin queries the MCP server for available tools.
 • When a tool (such as a code interpreter or file diff utility) is selected, the IDE sends a JSON‑RPC request to the MCP server.
 • The server processes the request (perhaps by invoking a Python subprocess for code interpretation) and streams the result back to the IDE.
3. Real-time Updates:
 • The IDE plugin displays the result inline or in a dedicated panel, updating as additional output becomes available.
4. Shutdown:
 • Once the IDE session ends or the user closes the tool panel, the MCP server gracefully terminates the connection.

7. Developer Best Practices
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument both the MCP server and the IDE extension to log requests, responses, and any errors for easier debugging.
 • Testing and Simulation:
 • Develop unit tests for tool callbacks and integration tests for end-to-end communication.
 • Simulate high-load or real-time editing scenarios to verify that the integration meets performance requirements.
 • Documentation:
 • Document the available MCP tools, schemas, and usage examples so that IDE users understand how to invoke these tools effectively.
 • Extensibility:
 • Design your integration with future expansions in mind—allowing additional MCP servers to be registered, or new tool types to be added without requiring major rework in the IDE.

By focusing on these core areas—transport, dynamic discovery, UI integration, security, containerization, and robust testing—you can successfully integrate an MCP server with a cursor IDE (such as one developed by Any Sphere). This integration not only enhances the IDE’s capabilities by leveraging external tool functions but also creates a modular and scalable workflow for real-time, context-sensitive interactions.
The page you referenced is part of the GenAIScript documentation and explains how GenAIScript integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to support portable tool definitions. In summary:

Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP is an emerging standard that defines a protocol for sharing tools and consuming them in a uniform way regardless of the underlying framework or runtime. GenAIScript implements a client for MCP tools so that you can integrate external tool servers seamlessly into your AI scripts.

Configuring Servers

You can declare a set of server configurations using the defTool function. This configuration is similar to what you’d specify in the Claude configuration file. For example, you can set up servers to provide memory and filesystem functionalities:

defTool({
    memory: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
    },
    filesystem: {
        command: "npx",
        args: [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
            path.resolve("."),
        ],
    },
})

When you do this, GenAIScript will launch the specified server and automatically register all the tools provided by that server. The registered tool identifiers are prefixed (e.g., server_toolname) to avoid naming conflicts.

Lifecycle of Servers

The documentation explains that:
 • Startup: Servers are started when rendering the prompt.
 • Shutdown: They are stopped once the chat session is completed.
 • Inline Prompts: If you define servers in an inline prompt, the server is started and stopped for each such prompt.

This design ensures that your tool servers are active only as long as needed for the specific prompt session.

Finding Servers

For discovering available MCP servers, the documentation points you to the Model Context Protocol Servers project. This external resource provides a list of ready-to-use server implementations, allowing you to quickly incorporate a variety of tools into your GenAIScript workflows.

Conclusion

In essence, the Model Context Protocol Tools documentation for GenAIScript guides you through how to:
 • Define server configurations using defTool.
 • Integrate these servers so that the LLM can call on them as tools.
 • Manage the lifecycle of these servers efficiently during prompt execution.

This integration makes it easier to extend your scripts with additional functionalities (like memory or filesystem operations) provided by external tool servers, all while adhering to a standardized protocol.

If you have any more questions about using MCP tools in your GenAIScript projects, feel free to ask!

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn’t so much about prescribing a fixed list of “Gen AI tools” as it is about defining a standard way for AI applications to integrate external functions—that is, “tools”—into their workflows. In other words, MCP provides the plumbing for clients (like GenAIScript) to discover, invoke, and manage tools regardless of the underlying implementation. Below is an overview of what this means in practice:

MCP and Tool Integration in Gen AI

1. The Role of Tools in MCP
 • Framework for Interoperability: MCP establishes a client–server architecture where “tools” are simply functions (or endpoints) that can be invoked by an AI client.
 • Standard Messaging: Whether it’s a file operation, a Git command, a web search, or a math evaluation, tools are communicated via a standardized JSON‑RPC message format over transports (like stdio or HTTP with SSE).
 • Dynamic Discovery: Clients can query MCP servers for available prompts and tools. For example, an endpoint like prompts/list lets a client know what reusable prompt templates (and, by extension, tools) are available.

2. Feature Support Matrix in the MCP Document
The document (from modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt  ￼) includes a matrix of client applications that support various MCP features. In this matrix, “Tools” is one of the key features—indicating that a given client can execute external tool functions. For example:
 • Claude Desktop App, Firebase Genkit, Continue, GenAIScript, Cline, LibreChat, TheiaAI/TheiaIDE, Superinterface, 5ire, and Bee Agent Framework all support MCP tools.
This means these clients can call out to external functions (tools) as part of their conversational or code-assistance workflows.

GenAIScript’s Approach to Tools

While MCP sets the protocol, platforms like GenAIScript provide concrete tool definitions that you can use. In GenAIScript (which implements an MCP client), tools are defined using the defTool function. These tools are essentially JavaScript functions that can be invoked by the language model during prompt assembly. Some examples of the kinds of tools provided in GenAIScript include:
 • File System Tools:
 • fs_ask_file – Query file content.
 • fs_read_file – Read text from a file.
 • fs_diff_files – Compute differences between files.
 • Version Control Tools:
 • git_status, git_diff – Get repository status or compute file diffs.
 • Other Git operations like listing branches or commits.
 • GitHub Integration:
 • Tools for listing pull requests, issues, and file contents from GitHub repositories.
 • Math and Computation Tools:
 • math_eval – Evaluate arithmetic or mathematical expressions.
 • Markdown and Metadata Tools:
 • md_find_files, md_read_frontmatter – Work with markdown documentation.
 • meta_prompt, meta_schema – Generate schema or process prompt metadata.
 • Code Interpreter Tools:
 • python_code_interpreter_run and related functions enable running Python code in a sandbox.
 • Retrieval and Search Tools:
 • retrieval_web_search, retrieval_vector_search – Perform web or vector-based searches.
 • Media and Vision Tools:
 • video_probe, video_extract_audio, video_extract_frames – Process video files.
 • vision_ask_images – Analyze images via AI vision models.
 • User Interaction Tools:
 • user_input_confirm, user_input_select, user_input_text – Get confirmation or input from the user.

Each of these tools is registered in the GenAIScript environment so that when an LLM is assembling an answer, it can decide to invoke one of these functions if it determines that additional context or a computation is needed.

Summary
 • MCP’s Role: MCP defines how AI applications exchange tool calls, prompts, and resources in a standardized way. It doesn’t fix a particular set of tools but rather defines how tools should be integrated.
 • GenAIScript Example: In GenAIScript, developers can define a rich set of tools (from file system queries to Git operations and math evaluations) using a simple JavaScript API (defTool). This allows the LLM to augment its answers by, for example, reading files, running computations, or even fetching web data.
 • Ecosystem Support: The MCP document shows that many Gen AI platforms support tool integration. The “Tools” column in the feature support matrix highlights which clients (like GenAIScript) have built-in support for these dynamic functions.

This flexible, protocol-based approach is at the heart of modern Gen AI systems, enabling them to extend their capabilities far beyond plain text generation by leveraging external tools and data sources.B

This outline provides a roadmap for leveraging the MCP support matrix to integrate and deploy valuable tools across various MCP-enabled environments. By following these guidelines, developers can extend the capabilities of Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, and other related server configurations using custom Docker setups—all while maintaining compatibility and adhering to MCP’s standards.

Below are several Dockerfile configuration templates for MCP servers that you might run locally. These templates target different MCP tool servers—such as a memory server, a filesystem server, and a custom MCP server (for example, one that might integrate additional tools for local use). You can use these templates to build local Docker images that provide MCP functionality for clients like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or even for specialized “cursor” MCP workflows.

1. Dockerfile for an MCP Memory Server

This template is designed for a Node.js–based MCP memory server. It uses a lightweight Alpine image and invokes the MCP memory server through npx. (This is useful when you want a local in-memory store for context or session data.)

# Dockerfile for MCP Memory Server

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Ensure npx is available (it is bundled with Node.js, but installing globally ensures latest behavior)

RUN npm install -g npx

# (Optional) Expose a port if your memory server also supports network-based transports

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP memory server using npx

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-memory-server .

Then run locally. This container will launch the memory server for local MCP integration.

2. Dockerfile for an MCP Filesystem Server

This template is similar to the memory server but tailored for a filesystem server. It assumes the server will work on a local directory (for example, to offer file read/diff capabilities). You can mount a host volume so that the server operates on your local files.

# Dockerfile for MCP Filesystem Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN npm install -g npx

# Expose a port if your configuration uses HTTP/SSE transports (optional)

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the MCP filesystem server

# Here, "/data" is used as the target directory inside the container

CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t mcp-filesystem-server .

Run with a volume mount so that your local directory is available inside the container:

docker run -v "$(pwd)/my-local-data:/data" -p 3000:3000 mcp-filesystem-server

3. Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server with Additional Tools

If you need a custom MCP server that registers extra tools or integrates custom logic (for instance, combining file, Git, or code interpreter tools into a single server), you can create a Node.js–based server. Place your custom server code (e.g., in a file called custom-server.js) in your project, then use the following Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile for a Custom MCP Server

FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy your custom MCP server code and any additional files

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your custom server communicates over HTTP or SSE

EXPOSE 3000

# Start your custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "custom-server.js"]

Usage:
Build with

docker build -t custom-mcp-server .

Run locally with

docker run -p 3000:3000 custom-mcp-server

Your custom-server.js might include logic to register multiple tools (using the MCP protocol) for handling tasks such as file diffs, Git operations, or even interactive prompts. This gives you the flexibility to tailor the MCP server’s behavior for local development or for specialized use cases (such as “cursor” MCP servers).

4. Optional: Docker Compose for Multi-Server Local Development

If you need to run several MCP servers concurrently (for example, one for memory, one for filesystem, and one custom server), you can use a Docker Compose file:

version: '3'
services:
  mcp-memory:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-memory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"

  mcp-filesystem:
    build:
      context: ./mcp-filesystem
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"

  custom-mcp:
    build:
      context: ./custom-mcp
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"

Usage:
Place each Dockerfile in its respective subdirectory (e.g., ./mcp-memory, ./mcp-filesystem, ./custom-mcp), then run:

docker-compose up --build

This setup lets you develop and test local MCP integrations across multiple servers simultaneously.

Conclusion

These Dockerfile templates provide a foundation for local MCP server deployments. They are intended for use in environments like Claude Desktop MCP or emerging clients such as Goose MCP, where running MCP servers locally can enhance privacy, performance, and ease of testing. You can further customize these templates to include additional tools or modify their transport configurations as needed by your local development or production workflow.

Below is an example Dockerfile that sets up a custom MCP server container. In this example, the container is built from a Node.js base image (using Debian‑based “slim” images) and installs Python alongside the Node environment. This enables you to integrate both:

 1. Code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API (for example, via a registered tool that calls out to a Python subprocess with required libraries), and
 2. GenAIScript tools from the MCP support matrix (which you would register in your custom server code).

In your custom server code (for example, in a file named server.js), you would use the MCP protocol to register tools such as a python_code_interpreter_run tool along with other GenAIScript functions. (The server code is not shown here, but it would follow the guidelines for using MCP and defTool to register your tools.)

Below is the Dockerfile:

# Use a Node.js slim image that supports apt-get

FROM node:18-slim

# Install Python3 and pip so that the container can run Python-based code interpreter tools

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install the Python packages needed by the code interpreter tool

# These versions match the limitations (e.g. numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that the GenAIScript code interpreter tool might require

RUN pip3 install numpy==2.1.3 pandas==2.2.3 scipy==1.14.1 matplotlib==3.9.2

# Set the working directory

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install Node.js dependencies (including GenAIScript modules and any MCP SDK libraries)

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the custom MCP server code that integrates both OpenAI assistance API code interpreter tools and GenAIScript tools

# For example, server.js registers your tools via defTool or similar mechanisms

COPY . .

# Optionally expose a port if your MCP server uses HTTP or SSE transport

EXPOSE 3000

# (Optional) Pass your OpenAI API key as an environment variable if your code interpreter tool requires it

# ENV OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Run the custom MCP server

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How This Dockerfile Works

 1. Base Image and Python Setup:
 • The image starts with a Node.js base (node:18-slim).
 • It installs Python 3 and pip so that Python-based tools (such as a code interpreter module) can run.
 • It then installs the required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib) that are typically allowed for the code interpreter tool.
 2. Node.js Environment and Dependencies:
 • The working directory is set to /app where the Node.js server code resides.
 • The Node dependencies (including any MCP/GenAIScript libraries) are installed via npm.
 3. Custom MCP Server Code:
 • Your application code (for example, server.js) is copied into the container. This code is expected to use the MCP protocol to register tools:
 • A tool that leverages the OpenAI Assistance API for code interpretation (for instance, by invoking Python scripts or making API calls).
 • Additional GenAIScript tools (such as file system operations, Git commands, or other utility functions from the MCP matrix).
 4. Port Exposure and Execution:
 • The container exposes port 3000 if needed for HTTP/SSE transport.
 • Finally, the container is configured to start the MCP server by running node server.js.

This template provides a starting point for integrating both types of tools in a Dockerized local MCP server. You can further customize the server code and environment variables as needed for your specific integration scenario.

Below is an example and explanation that describe how you can register your custom server code to expose GenAIScript (or “Jeni script”) tools via MCP. In this example, we show how to define two types of tools—a code interpreter tool (which might call the OpenAI Assistance API or run Python code locally) and a file system tool (as an example from the MCP support matrix). You can then register these tools in your custom MCP server code so that MCP‐clients (such as Claude Desktop or Goose MCP) can invoke them.

Example: Custom MCP Server Code Registration

Below is an example of a Node.js script (for example, named server.js) that uses an MCP server SDK (or your own MCP wrapper) to register tools. (Adjust the module names and API calls to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.) In this sample, we use a hypothetical defTool function to register tools and a Server class to launch the MCP server on a selected transport (for example, standard I/O or HTTP).

// server.js
// Import required modules. Adjust these imports to match your actual MCP/GenAIScript SDK.
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import fs from "fs/promises";

// A helper function for tool registration. In GenAIScript you might use `defTool`.
// Here, we create a simple registry object.
const toolRegistry = {};

/**

- Registers a tool for the MCP server.
- @param {string} id - The unique tool identifier.
- @param {string} description - A brief description of the tool.
- @param {object} schema - JSON schema for the tool's parameters.
- @param {Function} callback - The function to execute when the tool is called.
 */
function defTool(id, description, schema, callback) {
  toolRegistry[id] = { description, schema, callback };
  console.log(`Registered tool: ${id}`);
}

// Example 1: Code Interpreter Tool
// This tool accepts Python code and returns a simulated output.
// In a real scenario, you might call out to the OpenAI Assistance API or execute code securely.
defTool(
  "python_code_interpreter_run",
  "Executes Python code and returns the result.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      code: { type: "string", description: "Python code to execute" }
    },
    required: ["code"]
  },
  async ({ code }) => {
    // (Placeholder) Simulate executing Python code.
    // In production, you could spawn a Python process or call an external API.
    console.log("Executing Python code:", code);
    // For illustration, return a dummy result.
    return `Executed code: ${code.substring(0, 30)}...`;
  }
);

// Example 2: File Read Tool
// This tool reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.
defTool(
  "fs_read_file",
  "Reads a file from the filesystem and returns its content.",
  {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filePath: { type: "string", description: "Absolute or relative file path" }
    },
    required: ["filePath"]
  },
  async ({ filePath }) => {
    try {
      const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf8");
      return content;
    } catch (err) {
      return `Error reading file: ${err.message}`;
    }
  }
);

// Initialize and start the MCP server.
async function startMcpServer() {
  // Create an instance of your MCP server.
  const server = new Server(
    { name: "custom-mcp-server", version: "1.0.0" },
    {
      // You can declare supported capabilities here.
      capabilities: {
        tools: Object.keys(toolRegistry)
      }
    }
  );

  // Set a generic request handler that dispatches tool calls.
  // In a production implementation, you might match the request's method to a tool ID.
  server.setRequestHandler(async (request) => {
    const { method, params } = request;
    if (toolRegistry[method]) {
      try {
        const result = await toolRegistry[method].callback(params);
        return { result };
      } catch (error) {
        return { error: { message: error.message } };
      }
    } else {
      return { error: { message: `Tool ${method} not found` } };
    }
  });

  // Create a transport (here using standard I/O).
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);

  console.log("MCP server started and awaiting requests...");
}

// Run the server
startMcpServer().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error starting MCP server:", err);
});

Explanation

 1. Tool Registration with defTool:
 • The defTool function is defined to store tool definitions (ID, description, JSON schema, and callback function) in a registry.
 • Two tools are registered:
 • python_code_interpreter_run: Simulates execution of Python code. In a real integration, you could spawn a Python subprocess or call the OpenAI Assistance API.
 • fs_read_file: Reads a file using Node’s filesystem API and returns its content.
 2. Setting Up the MCP Server:
 • A new MCP server instance is created with a name and version. In its capabilities, it declares that it supports the tools whose IDs were registered.
 • A generic request handler is set up so that when a client sends a request with a method corresponding to one of the tool IDs, the server dispatches the call to the registered callback.
 • The server connects using a transport (in this example, a standard I/O transport via StdioServerTransport).
 3. Integration with MCP Clients:
 • Once the server is running, MCP-enabled clients (e.g., Claude Desktop MCP or Goose MCP) can discover the available tools (listed in the capabilities) and invoke them using the MCP protocol.
 • The tool callbacks then execute the custom logic (e.g., interpreting code or reading a file) and return the results.

How to Use This with a Docker Container

You can combine the above server code with the Dockerfile example provided previously. For instance, if your Dockerfile copies this server.js into the container and runs it, you will have a Dockerized custom MCP server that exposes both the code interpreter and GenAIScript tools.

This approach allows you to integrate code interpreter tools from the OpenAI Assistance API and other GenAIScript tools (as shown in the MCP support matrix) into a single, custom MCP server that can be deployed locally or via Docker.

Feel free to adjust the tool implementations and server configuration to match your actual application logic and the APIs you are using.

Below are several additional concepts and best practices that are integral to properly configuring and executing MCP protocols. These considerations complement the configuration and tool registration details we’ve discussed:

1. Transport Layer & Communication
 • Multiple Transports:
 • Choose the appropriate transport mechanism (e.g., stdio for local processes, HTTP with SSE for remote or web-based connections) and ensure that the protocol (typically JSON‑RPC 2.0) is consistently followed.
 • Message Framing & Schema Validation:
 • Implement strict JSON schema validation for all messages to ensure that requests, notifications, and error messages adhere to the expected format.
 • This minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and injection attacks.

2. Security and Access Controls
 • Authentication and Authorization:
 • Integrate secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys, mutual TLS) to restrict access to MCP servers.
 • Data Integrity & Encryption:
 • Ensure that all data exchanged between clients and servers is encrypted in transit (using TLS/SSL for HTTP-based transports).
 • Input Sanitization:
 • Validate and sanitize all incoming messages and parameters to prevent malicious inputs from causing unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

3. Tool & Prompt Standardization
 • Uniform Schema Definitions:
 • Define clear, reusable JSON schemas for each tool and prompt. This ensures interoperability between various clients (like Claude Desktop MCP, Goose MCP, or custom implementations).
 • Dynamic Discovery:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., prompts/list or tool registry queries) that allow clients to dynamically discover available tools and prompts.
 • This flexibility aids in integrating new functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

4. Lifecycle Management and Error Handling
 • Startup and Shutdown:
 • Ensure that MCP servers are started at prompt initialization and shut down cleanly at the end of a session to free up resources.
 • Robust Error Handling:
 • Standardize error codes and messages (e.g., following JSON‑RPC error codes) so that clients can properly interpret and react to issues.
 • Logging and Monitoring:
 • Instrument the server to log incoming requests, responses, errors, and performance metrics.
 • Use health checks and diagnostics to monitor server status, which is especially useful in containerized deployments.

5. Containerization & Deployment Best Practices
 • Docker and Orchestration:
 • Use Docker to encapsulate the MCP server along with its dependencies (e.g., Node.js, Python runtime for code interpreter tools).
 • For more complex deployments, employ orchestration tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage multiple MCP servers concurrently.
 • CI/CD Integration:
 • Automate builds, tests, and deployments of MCP server containers to ensure consistency across environments.
 • Versioning:
 • Manage version compatibility between MCP clients and servers, making sure that protocol updates are handled gracefully.

6. Developer Experience and Documentation
 • Comprehensive Documentation:
 • Document tool registration, API endpoints, expected schemas, and error codes clearly.
 • This helps developers integrate new tools and debug issues effectively.
 • Testing and Debugging Tools:
 • Develop unit and integration tests for each registered tool.
 • Use interactive debugging tools (for instance, built into development environments like Visual Studio Code) to simulate MCP interactions.
 • Fallback Mechanisms:
 • Implement fallback strategies for models that lack native tool support. For instance, use system prompts to mimic tool behavior when direct function calls are not available.

7. Dynamic and Agentic Workflows
 • Chaining Prompts:
 • Design prompts and tool calls to be composable, allowing multiple interactions (or “agentic” workflows) that can process data sequentially or in parallel.
 • Real-time Interactivity:
 • For environments such as cursor-based or live-editing workflows, ensure that your MCP server supports low-latency, real-time message exchanges.

By carefully considering these aspects—from secure transport and strict message validation to robust error handling, containerization, and dynamic prompt discovery—you create a resilient, secure, and extensible MCP integration. These additional concepts help ensure that your protocols execute correctly in a variety of deployment scenarios and that new tools can be added with minimal disruption.

Below is a detailed, step‐by‐step guideline to create a local Docker configuration that runs a Claude Desktop MCP server integration. This guide assumes you have some familiarity with Docker, Node.js, and basic command‐line operations.

1. Prerequisites
 • Install Docker:
Ensure that Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) is installed and running on your system.
 • Basic Node.js Knowledge:
The MCP server application is built on Node.js (version 18 or higher). (In our Dockerfile we’ll use a Node 18 Alpine image, so no local Node installation is strictly required for container builds.)
 • Claude Desktop:
Make sure you have Claude Desktop installed and that you’ve enabled MCP support within Cursor if needed (via Settings > Advanced → type mcp:enable).

2. Set Up the Project Directory

Create a new directory for your MCP server project. For example:

mkdir claude-mcp-server
cd claude-mcp-server

Within this directory, you will create all necessary configuration files, application code, and Docker configuration files.

3. Create the MCP Server Application Code

For demonstration, we’ll build a minimal MCP server using Express. Create an index.js file with the following content:

// index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.MCP_SERVER_PORT || 3030;

app.use(express.json());

// Example MCP endpoint that Claude Desktop can call
app.post('/mcp/v1/execute', async (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  console.log('Received MCP payload:', payload);

  // Process the payload (e.g., parse tool calls and perform actions)
  // Here, we simply return a test response
  res.json({
    responses: [{
      type: 'data',
      content: 'Test response from local MCP server'
    }]
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Server running on port ${port}`);
});

This code creates a basic HTTP server that listens on a configurable port (defaulting to 3030) and exposes an MCP endpoint at /mcp/v1/execute.

4. Set Up package.json

Initialize a package.json to define your Node.js application and its dependencies. Create or edit package.json with the following content:

{
  "name": "claude-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

You can create this file manually or run npm init -y and then install Express:

npm install express

5. Create the Dockerfile

Next, create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory. This Dockerfile builds your MCP server image:

# Use Node.js v18 Alpine image for a lightweight container

FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if present)

COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies

RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code

COPY . .

# Expose the port (default 3030)

EXPOSE 3030

# Run the application

CMD ["npm", "start"]

This file instructs Docker to build a container that installs your Node.js dependencies and starts your MCP server.

6. Create a docker-compose.yml File

For easier management, create a docker-compose.yml file that defines your service:

version: '3.8'

services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    env_file: .env
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    restart: unless-stopped

This configuration builds the image from your Dockerfile, maps port 3030 from the container to your host, loads environment variables from a .env file, and mounts your project directory so that changes are visible inside the container.

7. Create an Environment Variables File

Create a file named .env in your project directory. For example:

# .env

MCP_SERVER_PORT=3030

# (Add any additional environment variables as needed)

This file makes it easy to modify configuration settings without changing the code.

8. Build and Run Your Docker Container

From the project directory, build and run the container with:

docker-compose up --build

You should see logs indicating that your MCP server is running on port 3030. For example:

mcp-server  | MCP Server running on port 3030

9. Configure Claude Desktop to Connect to the Local MCP Server

Now that your MCP server is running locally, configure Claude Desktop to integrate with it:

 1. Open Claude Desktop’s MCP Configuration Panel:
Navigate to the MCP or integration settings in Claude Desktop. This might be accessible via a “Settings” or “Advanced” menu.
 2. Add a New MCP Server Entry:
Enter the following configuration details (this may be done via a JSON configuration snippet or through a GUI):

{
  "name": "local-mcp",
  "type": "mcp",
  "config": {
    "server": "<http://localhost:3030/mcp/v1/execute>",
    "capabilities": ["cursor_control", "window_management"]
  }
}

This tells Claude Desktop to communicate with your local MCP server endpoint.

 3. Save and Restart:
Save your configuration and restart Claude Desktop if necessary to ensure the new settings take effect.

10. Test the Integration
 • Trigger a Test Command:
In Claude Desktop, send a test command or tool invocation that uses the MCP server. For instance, if Claude sends a JSON payload to your endpoint, check that your container logs show the received payload and that Claude receives the expected test response.
 • Monitor Logs:
Use Docker logs (docker-compose logs -f) to view real-time output from your MCP server and troubleshoot any issues.

11. Troubleshooting Tips
 • Port Conflicts:
Ensure that port 3030 is not already in use on your host machine. Adjust the port in your .env and Docker configurations if necessary.
 • Container Logs:
If something isn’t working, check container logs using:

docker-compose logs -f

 • Network Settings:
Verify that Claude Desktop can reach <http://localhost:3030> (or your adjusted host address). Firewall or network settings might block the connection.
 • Configuration Verification:
Double-check that your MCP endpoint URL is correctly entered in Claude Desktop’s configuration.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you have set up a local Docker configuration that runs an MCP server integrated with Claude Desktop. This local environment lets you test and develop MCP-based interactions, enabling Claude Desktop to leverage context-aware commands and enhanced AI-assisted workflows.

Feel free to extend your MCP server code to include additional endpoints, advanced logging, and real integrations tailored to your development needs.

Below is an outline of a Dockerfile designed to package a sample MCP server configuration for testing with a cursor‐based IDE integration. This sample configuration assumes that you have a Node.js–based MCP server (for example, defined in a file like server.js) that registers your tools and supports dynamic prompt discovery for a cursor IDE. You can adjust the configuration as needed.

# Dockerfile for Testing a Sample MCP Configuration with Cursor Integration

# Use a lightweight Node.js base image

FROM node:18-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container

WORKDIR /app

# Install global dependencies (npx is included with Node, but this ensures you have it up-to-date)

RUN npm install -g npx

# Copy package.json (and package-lock.json, if available) to install local dependencies

COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies

RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the MCP server source code into the container

# Your code should include server.js and any modules required for tool registration

COPY . .

# Expose a port if your MCP server uses an HTTP or SSE transport

# This allows the cursor IDE to connect to the MCP server

EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the MCP server

# This should launch your custom server that registers tools (e.g., code interpreter, file operations) and supports dynamic discovery

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

How to Use This Dockerfile

 1. Prepare Your MCP Server Code:
Ensure that your project includes a server.js file (or another entry point) that:
 • Sets up an MCP server (using your chosen MCP SDK or custom implementation).
 • Registers tools using a function like defTool (for example, tools for code interpretation or file system operations).
 • Exposes discovery endpoints (e.g., for listing tools/prompts) so that a cursor-based IDE can dynamically discover and invoke the tools.
 2. Build the Docker Image:
In the directory containing your Dockerfile and server code, run:

docker build -t mcp-cursor-test .

 3. Run the Docker Container:
For local testing, start the container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 mcp-cursor-test

This command maps the container’s port 3000 to your host so that your cursor IDE (or test client) can connect to the MCP server.

 4. Integrate with Your Cursor IDE:
Configure your cursor IDE (or its extension/plugin) to connect to the MCP server at the appropriate address (e.g., <http://localhost:3000>). The IDE should then be able to query the MCP server for available tools, invoke them, and display results inline.

Additional Considerations
 • Environment Variables:
If your MCP server requires configuration values (such as API keys or transport settings), consider adding ENV directives in the Dockerfile or passing them at runtime using docker run --env.
 • Logging and Debugging:
Ensure your MCP server logs incoming requests and errors. This helps when testing the integration with the cursor IDE.
 • Extensibility:
You can extend this basic Dockerfile to include additional dependencies (for instance, Python or other runtime libraries) if your tools require them.

This outline should serve as a starting point for building and testing a sample MCP configuration that integrates with a cursor-based IDE. Adjust the server implementation and Dockerfile details as needed to match your specific tool registration and runtime environment.

Integrating an MCP server with a cursor-based IDE—such as one built by Any Sphere or a similar environment—requires careful planning to ensure that the server’s tool capabilities and dynamic prompt interactions are seamlessly available within the IDE’s workflow. Below are several key concepts and best practices, along with an integration outline, that can help guide this process:

1. Establishing the Communication Channel
 • Transport Choice:
 • Local Development: For a local cursor IDE, you may prefer transports that minimize latency. Options include using standard I/O (for local testing) or a WebSocket/HTTP + SSE transport for IDE plugins.
 • Protocol Compliance:
 • Use JSON‑RPC 2.0 for framing messages so that both the MCP server and the IDE extension speak the same “language.”
 • Validate messages with JSON schemas to ensure consistency.

2. Tool and Prompt Discovery
 • Dynamic Discovery Endpoints:
 • Implement endpoints (e.g., tools/list or prompts/list) in the MCP server so that the IDE can query available tools dynamically.
 • This enables the cursor IDE to present tool options as clickable commands or context-sensitive menu items.
 • Standardized Tool Registration:
 • Use a method (for example, a custom defTool function) to register your tools. This keeps the registry consistent and allows the IDE to read the server’s capabilities (such as available code interpreter functions, file system operations, Git commands, etc.).

3. IDE Integration Considerations
 • Plugin or Extension Development:
 • Create an IDE plugin (or use an existing extension framework) that can connect to the MCP server. This plugin should handle authentication, service discovery, and manage tool invocations.
 • User Interface Adaptations:
 • For a cursor-based experience, map the MCP server’s capabilities to IDE UI elements like inline suggestions, right-click menus, or slash commands that appear next( O)>
