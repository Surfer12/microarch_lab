Below is a concise overview capturing the essential ideas from the provided documentation on GenAIScript's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools. Think of this summary as a quick-reference guide to how GenAIScript uses MCP, how ephemeral tool servers are defined and managed, and how Docker can be leveraged for local/offline development.

1. What the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Is

• Purpose: MCP is a standard for integrating external "tools"—functions or endpoints—into AI workflows. It specifies how to discover, invoke, and manage these tools using a uniform JSON-RPC interface.
• Client–Server Model: AI clients (e.g., GenAIScript, Claude Desktop) talk to servers that expose various tools (e.g., filesystem, Git, Python code execution).
