Below is a concise overview capturing the essential ideas from the provided documentation on GenAIScript’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools. Think of this summary as a quick-reference guide to how GenAIScript uses MCP, how ephemeral tool servers are defined and managed, and how Docker can be leveraged for local/offline development.

1. What the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Is
	•	Purpose: MCP is a standard for integrating external “tools”—functions or endpoints—into AI workflows. It specifies how to discover, invoke, and manage these tools using a uniform JSON-RPC interface.
	•	Client–Server Model: AI clients (e.g., GenAIScript, Claude Desktop) talk to servers that expose various tools (e.g., filesystem, Git, Python code execution).

2. GenAIScript’s Approach to MCP Tools
	1.	defTool Configuration
	•	You declare servers (e.g., filesystem, memory) via defTool({ ... }).
	•	Each server corresponds to a command (like npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory) that runs as an MCP server.
	•	Ephemeral Servers: They start up when you render a prompt and shut down once the prompt session completes.
	2.	Lifecycle Management
	•	Startup: Each tool server spins up just before the AI prompt that needs it.
	•	Shutdown: Servers stop automatically after the session.
	•	Inline Prompts: If you define servers inline, GenAIScript launches them for that prompt only, then kills them afterward.
	3.	Tool Discovery & Namespacing
	•	Tools from a server are automatically registered and exposed to the LLM.
	•	The tool IDs are often prefixed (like filesystem_read_file) to avoid naming clashes.
	•	You can discover available MCP servers (and their exposed tools) via resources like the Model Context Protocol Servers project.
	4.	Common Built-In Tools
	•	Filesystem: fs_read_file, fs_diff_files, etc.
	•	Git/Version Control: git_status, git_diff, etc.
	•	Math/Computation: math_eval, python_code_interpreter_run.
	•	Retrieval/Search: retrieval_web_search, etc.
	•	User Interaction: user_input_confirm, etc.
	•	Media: video_extract_audio, vision_ask_images, etc.

3. Dockerizing MCP Servers

Why Docker?
	•	Isolation: Each MCP server (memory, filesystem, custom) can run in a container, simplifying dependency management.
	•	Lifecycle & Scalability: Easy to spin up/down multiple servers, orchestrate them via Docker Compose, and ensure consistent environments for local or dev usage.

Example Dockerfiles
	1.	Memory Server (Node + @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory)

FROM node:18-alpine
RUN npm install -g npx
CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]


	2.	Filesystem Server (Node + @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem)

FROM node:18-alpine
RUN npm install -g npx
CMD ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]


	3.	Custom MCP Server
	•	Combine multiple tools in one container.
	•	Write your own server.js that registers tools (e.g. using a function like defTool) and responds to MCP requests.

Multi-Server Setup with Docker Compose
	•	You can define multiple services (memory, filesystem, custom) in a single docker-compose.yml.
	•	Each container exposes a port, letting AI clients (Claude, GenAIScript, etc.) discover and call them as needed.

4. Example: Registering Tools in a Custom MCP Server
	•	Registry Model: A helper like defTool(toolId, schema, callback) stores tool definitions.
	•	MCP Server Class: A server listens for JSON-RPC requests.
	•	Example Tools:
	•	python_code_interpreter_run (executes Python or calls an external API).
	•	fs_read_file (reads file from disk).

// Register the tool in your server code
defTool("fs_read_file", "Reads a file", { filePath: "string" }, async ({ filePath }) => {
  return fs.readFile(filePath, "utf-8");
});

	•	Integration: Clients (like GenAIScript or Claude Desktop) see these tools automatically once the server is up.

5. Advanced Topics & Best Practices
	1.	Transport Choices
	•	Stdio for local process integration.
	•	HTTP/SSE for remote or container-based usage.
	•	WebSockets for real-time interactions (e.g., in a live-coding IDE).
	2.	Security
	•	Consider authentication (API keys, OAuth, TLS).
	•	Validate inputs to prevent injection attacks.
	3.	Lifecycle & Error Handling
	•	Cleanly start/stop ephemeral servers.
	•	Use standardized JSON-RPC error codes for debugging.
	4.	Tool Schema & Discovery
	•	Provide clear JSON schemas for each tool’s parameters.
	•	Let clients query tools/list or prompts/list endpoints for dynamic usage.
	5.	Agentic Workflows
	•	Tools can chain: e.g., read a file, do a diff, run Python on the results.
	6.	Local vs. Remote
	•	Docker images let you run everything locally for offline dev.
	•	Or push to a remote environment with the same config.

6. Putting It All Together
	•	GenAIScript + MCP:
	•	Ephemeral tool servers declared via defTool.
	•	Automatic start/stop ensures they run only when needed.
	•	Tools become function calls accessible to the LLM in GenAIScript prompts.
	•	Docker:
	•	Eases local development, ensuring each MCP server’s environment is consistent.
	•	Allows you to test multiple servers (filesystem, memory, custom) simultaneously with Docker Compose.
	•	Use Cases
	•	Extend AI scripts with file operations, code interpretation, Git management, or web search.
	•	Combine or chain these tools in a single ephemeral session, or break them out into separate containers.
	•	Integration Examples
	•	In Claude Desktop: Provide the local MCP server’s endpoint in the config.
	•	In a cursor-based IDE: Use a plugin that queries the MCP server for available tools and runs them on-demand.

Final Thoughts

The documentation underscores how GenAIScript and MCP combine to give AI models a powerful, standardized way to access external functions—without locking you into a single environment or runtime. By packaging tools as ephemeral servers, you keep each session lightweight and secure. And by leveraging Docker, you can develop and test these integrations both locally (for offline dev) and in scalable production deployments.
