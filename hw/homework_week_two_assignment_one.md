• Explanation: Provide a brief overview of two's complement arithmetic.

• Definitions:

Two's Complement: A method for representing negative numbers in binary.

- Bit Width: The number of bits used for representation.

Annotated Example:

- Example: Convert the binary number 101 (3-bit) to its 2's complement.
- Steps:
    1. Identify the sign bit.
      2. Invert the bits (for negative numbers) and add 1.
- Partial Solution: For binary 101 -> Inversion gives 010; adding 1 yields 011.
