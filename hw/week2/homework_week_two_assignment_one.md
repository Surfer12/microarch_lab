The homework here is the same as is posted on the Week 2 page.

I'll do "don't cares" in class Monday. That should give you time to do the last problem before the homework is due. The short version is that if there is an output that is never seen (if you'll never see a particular input so you don't care what the output is), then you don't care what it is and in the table you write 'X' for that output's bit. Then, when you go to find logic, since that output will never be seen or used, you can pretend that output is anything that makes creating the logic easier for you. For us, since we are using SOP (sum of products) which adds a term every time you see a '1' in the output column, it's more convenient to just pretend the "don't cares" (Xs) are all '0's.
