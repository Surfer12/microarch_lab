  - Bit-level operations
  - Struct and memory layout
  - Compilation process

- **Recommended C Practice Areas**
  ```c
  // Example areas to practice
  int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);  // Dynamic memory allocation
  unsigned int bitwise_ops = 0x0F & 0xF0;  // Bitwise operations
  struct SystemState {
      int cpu_state;
      char* memory_ptr;
  };  // Struct design
  ```

### 2. Hardware Concepts
