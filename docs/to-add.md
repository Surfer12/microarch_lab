Visual Aids and Diagrams:
Create diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate complex concepts like compiler architecture stages or hardware interactions.

Use tools like Jupyter Notebooks to create interactive code examples where students can modify and run code snippets directly in the browser.
Include explanations and visualizations alongside code to help students understand the concepts better.

Quizzes and Interactive Exercises:
Integrate quizzes or interactive exercises at the end of each section to reinforce learning.

nteractive Simulations:
Develop simulations for hardware concepts or compiler processes that students can interact with.
