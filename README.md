# Microarchitecture Lab

## Overview
This Microarchitecture Lab is a comprehensive exploration of computer architecture principles, focusing on low-level system design, performance optimization, and architectural innovations.

## Project Structure

### Directories
- `src/`: Source code implementations
- `labs/`: Specific laboratory exercises and experiments
  - `c_language/`: In-depth exploration of microarchitecture concepts using C
- `examples/`: Illustrative code samples and demonstrations
- `docs/`: Documentation and technical references
- `resources/`: Additional learning materials and tools
