# C Language Microarchitecture Laboratory

## Overview
This laboratory focuses on exploring microarchitecture concepts through the C programming language, providing hands-on experience with low-level system programming and architectural principles.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand memory management and allocation
- Explore low-level system interactions
- Implement basic architectural simulations
- Develop skills in systems-level programming

## Topics Covered
1. Memory Management
2. Pointer Manipulation
3. Bit-level Operations
4. Basic Processor Simulation
5. Performance Optimization Techniques

## Prerequisites
- Basic C programming knowledge
- Understanding of computer architecture fundamentals
- Compiler: GCC or Clang recommended

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Source code implementations
- `docs/`: Detailed documentation and explanations
- `examples/`: Sample code and demonstrations
- `tests/`: Unit tests and verification scripts

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile individual projects using provided Makefiles

## Recommended Tools
- GDB (GNU Debugger)
- Valgrind for memory analysis
- Compiler optimization flags (-O2, -O3)

## Exercises
- Memory allocation and deallocation
- Implementing basic data structures
- Simulating simple processor operations
- Performance benchmarking

## Contributing
- Follow C coding standards
- Write clear, commented code
- Include appropriate error handling
- Provide test cases for new implementations
