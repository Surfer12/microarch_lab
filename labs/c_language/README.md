# C Language Microarchitecture Lab

## Overview

This directory contains low-level system programming examples, memory management techniques, and performance optimization demonstrations using C.

## Directory Structure

- `src/`: Source code implementations
- `tests/`: Test frameworks and test cases
  - `test_framework.h`: Custom testing framework
  - `memory_tests.c`: Memory management test cases

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Memory Management**
   - Manual memory allocation techniques
   - Pointer manipulation
   - Memory visualization tools

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient data structures
   - Compiler optimization strategies
   - Low-level performance profiling

3. **System-Level Programming**
   - Direct hardware interaction
   - Low-level system calls
   - Memory layout and alignment

## Prerequisites

- GCC or Clang compiler
- Make build system
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with low-level system concepts

## Building and Running

```bash
# Compile all sources
make

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Memory Visualizer

The `memory_visualizer.c` provides insights into:
- Memory allocation patterns
- Pointer tracking
- Memory usage analysis

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:
- Maintain code readability
- Add comprehensive comments
- Include test cases for new implementations
