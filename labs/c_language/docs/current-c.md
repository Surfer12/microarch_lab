I've scaffolded a comprehensive C language lab within the Microarchitecture Lab project. The structure includes:
1. A dedicated README for the C language lab
A flexible Makefile for compilation
A sample source file demonstrating memory operations
A basic test file for memory-related operations
Updated main project README to include the new lab
Key features of the scaffolding:
Demonstrates memory allocation and pointer manipulation
Includes a basic test suite
Provides clear documentation and setup instructions
Follows good C programming practices
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the scaffolding or add more specific microarchitecture-related examples?
