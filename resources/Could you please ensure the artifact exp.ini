Could you please ensure the artifact explains and demonstrates properties like Associative and Commutative in discrete mathematics?  It should also explain parenthesis and notation in logic, especially focusing on negation and its distribution over operators, and compare this to mathematical negation if relevant.  Please use mathematical notation and a practical programming perspective, including Java examples.  Also, please include LaTeX notation, truth tables, and implementation examples in both Python and Java.  Finally, the artifact should provide a comprehensive overview of logical operations and cover key terms in Propositional and Predicate Logic.
