Monday 1/27:  Numbers. Positive binary, and 2's complement numbers.

Prep:

Part 1: Make sure to do the homework for last week. We will be building on base-2 so please be comfortable with it when you come to class. If you want more practice, randomly pick a number and check your answer ( https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html Links to an external site. )

Plus more new for today: Gates! Download Gates!

In Class (Lecture):

First hour: Lecture will be on 2's complement numbers and gates and circuit design with gates. Some practice on 2's complement and then we'll look at what a gate is and how to use them to build circuits. Building circuits will go into second hour.

LTSpice should be installed on the lab/classroom computers. We'll go through this in class but here are some videos to help if you forget anything:
