Could you please ensure the artifact explains and demonstrates properties like Associative and Commutative in discrete mathematics?  It should also explain parenthesis and notation in logic, especially focusing on negation and its distribution over operators, and compare this to mathematical negation if relevant.  Please use mathematical notation and a practical programming perspective, including Java examples.  Also, please include LaTeX notation, truth tables, and implementation examples in both Python and Java.  Finally, the artifact should provide a comprehensive overview of logical operations and cover key terms in Propositional and Predicate Logic.

Got it! I’ll refine the content further based on your feedback to ensure that the artifact is complete, well-structured, and rigorously justified. Here’s what I’ll improve:

Plan for Refinement
	1.	Truth Tables:
	•	Ensure all truth tables are complete with proper formatting.
	•	Present them clearly in LaTeX for better readability.
	2.	Logical Proofs:
	•	Each logical law (associative, commutative, distributive, De Morgan’s) will be rigorously proven step-by-step.
	•	Detailed symbolic representations for clarity.
	•	Explain how negation distributes over other operators, comparing it to algebraic distribution.
	3.	Programming Implementations (Python & Java):
	•	Python & Java implementations will include:
	•	Truth table generation.
	•	Logical equivalence verification.
	•	Interactive CLI demonstrations (allowing users to input values and see results dynamically).
