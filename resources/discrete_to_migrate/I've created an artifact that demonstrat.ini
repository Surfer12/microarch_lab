I've created an artifact that demonstrates the discrete mathematics concepts you highlighted, including:

Logical operators (AND, OR)
De Morgan's Laws
Propositional equivalences
LaTeX notation
Truth tables
A Python implementation example

The artifact provides a comprehensive overview of logical operations, using both mathematical notation and a practical programming perspective


Here’s a breakdown of the key terms and truth tables associated with Predicate and Propositional Logic, Conjunction and Disjunction, De Morgan’s Laws, and Properties like Associative and Commutative:

1. Key Terms in Predicate and Propositional Logic
	•	Propositional Logic: Deals with statements (propositions) that are either true or false.
	•	Predicate Logic: Extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers (e.g., ∀ for “for all”, ∃ for “there exists”) and variables.
	•	Atomic Proposition: A single statement with a truth value.
	•	Logical Connectives:
	•	Conjunction ( ∧ ): “AND” operation.
	•	Disjunction ( ∨ ): “OR” operation.
	•	Negation ( ¬ ): “NOT” operation.
	•	Implication ( → ): “If-then” statement.
	•	Biconditional ( ↔ ): “If and only if” statement.
	•	Tautology: A proposition that is always true.
	•	Contradiction: A proposition that is always false.
	•	Contingency: A proposition that is sometimes true and sometimes false.

2. Truth Tables

Conjunction (AND, ∧)

￼	￼	￼
T	T	T
T	F	F
F	T	F
F	F	F

Disjunction (OR, ∨)

￼	￼	￼
T	T	T
T	F	T
F	T	T
F	F	F

De Morgan’s Laws
	1.	Negation of Conjunction:
￼
Truth Table:

￼	￼	￼	￼	￼	￼	￼
T	T	T	F	F	F	F
T	F	F	T	F	T	T
F	T	F	T	T	F	T
F	F	F	T	T	T	T


	2.	Negation of Disjunction:
￼
Truth Table:

￼	￼	￼	￼	￼	￼	￼
T	T	T	F	F	F	F
T	F	T	F	F	T	F
F	T	T	F	T	F	F
F	F	F	T	T	T	T



De Morgan’s Laws show how negation interacts with conjunction and disjunction.

3. Properties in Logic
	•	Associative Property (Grouping does not affect the result):
	•	￼
	•	￼
	•	Commutative Property (Order does not affect the result):
	•	￼
	•	￼
	•	Distributive Property (Mixing AND and OR operations):
	•	￼
	•	￼
