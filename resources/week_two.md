Wednesday's lab still to be posted

Monday 1/27:  Numbers. Positive binary, and 2's complement numbers.

Prep:

Part 1: Make sure to do the homework for last week. We will be building on base-2 so please be comfortable with it when you come to class. If you want more practice, randomly pick a number and check your answer ( https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.htmlLinks to an external site. )

In Class (Lecture):

First hour: Lecture will be on 2's complement numbers and gates and circuit design with gates. Some practice on 2's complement and then we'll look at what a gate is and how to use them to build circuits. Building circuits will go into second hour.

LTSpice should be installed on the lab/classroom computers. We'll go through this in class but here are some videos to help if you forget anything:

What's due:

Lab stuff: We will do an introduction to the tools on Monday. Wednesday we will be building something more complicated. Monday's and Wednesdays lab work and the homework will be due next Monday 2/3.

Homework: 2's comp, truth tables, and KMapsDownload 2's comp, truth tables, and KMaps

>>>>>>>>>>>>> ======================== <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Wednesday 1/29:  Other values you might want to store and KMaps.

Prep:

Part 1: Reading on gates: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logic-gates/Links to an external site. .

Part 2: Review gates and creating logic from truth tables. Doing this part of the homework would be good prep.

Part 3: We'll do this in class but feel free to work ahead. KMap video (I couldn't find one I really liked... They all leave out something).Links to an external site.

In Class (Lecture):

First hour: Lecture will be on other kinds of data than numbers and KMaps.

In class (Lab):

Gates continued. Using simulator and building with gates. ALU.
