Here’s a refined pipeline outline and sample code that merges everything into one cohesive workflow—parsing, extracting key concepts, building spreadsheets and conceptual maps, and collecting related files. This approach is modular, so you can adapt each step as needed for future weeks or different types of content.

1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

A clear folder hierarchy helps keep source files separate from outputs. For instance:

/resources
  ├─ /week2
  │   ├─ homework_week_two_assignment_one.md
  │   ├─ week_two_overview.md
  │   ├─ ...
  ├─ /week3
  ├─ ...
/scripts
  ├─ parse_markdown.py
  ├─ generate_maps.py
  ├─ build_pipeline.sh
/output
  ├─ /week2
      ├─ spreadsheets
      ├─ diagrams
      ├─ references
  ├─ /week3
  ├─ ...

This structure will make it easier to run scripts that find source content in /resources/ and then produce outputs in /output/week2/.

2. PARSE THE SOURCE TEMPLATES (Markdown)

We’ll parse:
	•	homework_week_two_assignment_one.md
	•	week_two_overview.md

to separate out major headers, bullet points, tables, and key lines that might define important concepts.

2.1 Basic Markdown Parsing with Regex

Below is an extended Python example that goes beyond just capturing headers and bullets. It also tries to capture Markdown tables and any lines that appear to contain “key terms” (you can tweak the logic depending on how the text is structured):

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import re
import pandas as pd
import os
import sys

def parse_markdown(filepath):
    """
    Parses a Markdown file and returns:
      - headers (with level info)
      - bullet points
      - markdown tables (rows as lists)
      - lines that contain potential key terms (e.g., lines with 'key term:', 'definition:', etc.)
    """
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Headers -> (level, text)
    headers = re.findall(r'^(#+)\s+(.*)', content, re.MULTILINE)

    # Bullets -> lines that start with '-' or '*'
    bullets = re.findall(r'^[\-\*]\s+(.*)', content, re.MULTILINE)

    # Tables -> a simplified approach that grabs lines with '|' as potential table rows
    table_lines = []
    for line in content.split('\n'):
        if '|' in line:
            table_lines.append(line.strip())

    # Key terms -> optionally look for lines that start with "Key Term:" or "Definition:"
    # Adjust pattern to suit your actual usage
    key_terms = []
    for line in content.split('\n'):
        # Example pattern: "Key Term: 2's complement"
        # or "Definition: Binary representation"
        match = re.match(r'^(Key Term|Definition):\s*(.*)', line, re.IGNORECASE)
        if match:
            key_terms.append({
                'type': match.group(1),
                'text': match.group(2)
            })

    # Convert headers to structured data
    header_data = [
        {
            'level': len(h[0]),
            'header_text': h[1].strip()
        } for h in headers
    ]

    # Convert bullets to structured data
    bullet_data = [{'bullet': b.strip()} for b in bullets]

    return header_data, bullet_data, table_lines, key_terms

def generate_csv_output(header_data, bullet_data, key_terms, out_dir, filename_prefix):
    """Writes CSV files for headers, bullets, key terms."""
    os.makedirs(out_dir, exist_ok=True)

    df_headers = pd.DataFrame(header_data)
    df_bullets = pd.DataFrame(bullet_data)
    df_key_terms = pd.DataFrame(key_terms)

    df_headers.to_csv(os.path.join(out_dir, f"{filename_prefix}_headers.csv"), index=False)
    df_bullets.to_csv(os.path.join(out_dir, f"{filename_prefix}_bullets.csv"), index=False)
    if not df_key_terms.empty:
        df_key_terms.to_csv(os.path.join(out_dir, f"{filename_prefix}_key_terms.csv"), index=False)

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: parse_markdown.py <markdown_file_path> [output_directory]")
        sys.exit(1)

    md_file_path = sys.argv[1]
    out_dir = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) > 2 else "./output"

    filename_prefix = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(md_file_path))[0]
    header_data, bullet_data, table_lines, key_terms = parse_markdown(md_file_path)
    generate_csv_output(header_data, bullet_data, key_terms, out_dir, filename_prefix)

    # If you want to handle table_lines for CSV, you’ll need to parse them properly.
    # This might require checking for table headers vs. data rows, splitting by '|', etc.

    print(f"Finished parsing {md_file_path}.\nGenerated CSVs in {out_dir}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Usage Example:

cd scripts
python parse_markdown.py ../resources/week2/homework_week_two_assignment_one.md ../output/week2/spreadsheets
python parse_markdown.py ../resources/week2/week_two_overview.md ../output/week2/spreadsheets

3. EXTRACT AND STRUCTURE KEY CONCEPTS

After running the above script, you’ll have CSVs of headers, bullets, and (if present) “key terms.” You can now unify those into a single “Week2_Concepts.csv” if you like:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import pandas as pd
import os

def merge_csvs(csv_files, output_path):
    dfs = []
    for f in csv_files:
        try:
            dfs.append(pd.read_csv(f))
        except:
            pass
    if len(dfs) == 0:
        print("No CSVs to merge.")
        return
    merged_df = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True, sort=False)
    merged_df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
    print(f"Merged CSV saved at {output_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    folder = "../output/week2/spreadsheets"
    csv_files = [
        os.path.join(folder, "homework_week_two_assignment_one_headers.csv"),
        os.path.join(folder, "homework_week_two_assignment_one_bullets.csv"),
        os.path.join(folder, "homework_week_two_assignment_one_key_terms.csv"),
        os.path.join(folder, "week_two_overview_headers.csv"),
        os.path.join(folder, "week_two_overview_bullets.csv"),
        os.path.join(folder, "week_two_overview_key_terms.csv"),
    ]
    merge_csvs(csv_files, os.path.join(folder, "Week2_Concepts.csv"))

This final Week2_Concepts.csv can be your “master” spreadsheet of the extracted content.

4. GENERATE CONCEPTUAL MAPS AND DIAGRAMS

Once you have structured data (headers and bullet points that correspond to topics, subtopics, and so on), you can feed these into a visualization tool.

4.1 Using Graphviz (DOT Files)
	1.	Create a DOT file with nodes representing each high-level concept.
	2.	Link child bullet points to their respective headers.

Example:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import pandas as pd

def create_graphviz_dot(csv_path, dot_output_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
    # Let’s assume “level” indicates hierarchy, “header_text” for titles
    # This is a simplistic approach – you can get more sophisticated with references

    with open(dot_output_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write('digraph G {\n')
        f.write('  rankdir=LR;\n')  # or TB for top-bottom
        f.write('  node [shape=box];\n')

        # For each row that’s a header, create a node
        for idx, row in df.iterrows():
            if 'header_text' in row and not pd.isna(row['header_text']):
                node_name = f"node_{idx}"
                label = row['header_text'].replace('"', '\\"')
                f.write(f'  {node_name} [label="{label}", style=filled, fillcolor="#e0f7fa"];\n')

        # For bullet points, create smaller nodes or attach them to headers
        # A simplistic approach might just cluster them under their nearest header
        # In a more advanced approach, you'd track lines and sub-levels.

        f.write('}\n')

    print(f"DOT file created at {dot_output_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_graphviz_dot("../output/week2/spreadsheets/homework_week_two_assignment_one_headers.csv",
                        "../output/week2/diagrams/week2_homework.dot")

Then you can run:

dot -Tpdf ../output/week2/diagrams/week2_homework.dot -o ../output/week2/diagrams/week2_homework.pdf

Adjust the code to reflect how you want to represent bullet points vs. headers, or to add edges to show hierarchical relationships.

4.2 Using Mermaid in Markdown

If you prefer staying purely in Markdown, you can generate Mermaid syntax and embed it directly:

graph LR
  A[Numbers & Data] --> B[2's Complement]
  A --> C[Binary Arithmetic]
  ...

You can programmatically generate this snippet from your CSV data and paste it into a new .md file, which can then render as a diagram on compatible platforms (like GitHub or GitLab with Mermaid support).

5. HANDLE RELATED RESOURCES (PDFs, JPEGs, etc.)

When you store or reference additional resources:
	1.	Designate a folder inside /resources/week2/ for assets:

/resources
  ├─ /week2
  │   ├─ assets
  │   │   ├─ some_diagram.pdf
  │   │   ├─ ...


	2.	Copy or Link these resources into an output location. If you have a build script (e.g., build_pipeline.sh), add lines like:

mkdir -p ../output/week2/references
cp ../resources/week2/assets/*.pdf ../output/week2/references/


	3.	Embed or reference these files in your final combined output (like a README or an automatically generated index).

6. AUTOMATE & ITERATE

A single shell script or Makefile can run all steps in sequence whenever you update your .md files or resources:

build_pipeline.sh:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# 1. Parse markdown files
python parse_markdown.py ../resources/week2/homework_week_two_assignment_one.md ../output/week2/spreadsheets
python parse_markdown.py ../resources/week2/week_two_overview.md ../output/week2/spreadsheets

# 2. Merge CSVs for a master concept list
python merge_csvs.py

# 3. Create Graphviz diagrams
python generate_maps.py

# 4. Copy references (PDFs, JPEGs, etc.)
mkdir -p ../output/week2/references
cp ../resources/week2/assets/* ../output/week2/references/

echo "Week2 pipeline build complete!"

Then just run:

cd scripts
./build_pipeline.sh

…and the pipeline does all the heavy lifting: generating updated spreadsheets, merging them, producing diagrams, and copying reference materials.

Additional Notes
	1.	Recursive vs. Multi-layered Markdowns: If your markdown files nest headings deeply (like ### or ####), you can use the level from the regex captures to build a true tree structure. Then you can reflect that structure in your diagrams (e.g., child nodes pointing to parent nodes).
	2.	Table Extraction: If you use Markdown tables heavily (like K-maps or truth tables), you’ll want a more robust table parser. Tools like python-markdown or mistletoe can help parse tables. Then you can store table rows into a CSV more cleanly.
	3.	Cross-referencing: If the same concept (e.g., “2’s complement”) appears in both the overview and the homework, you can unify them in your final CSV to show multiple references to the concept, or track it with a “source” field.
	4.	Extending to NLP: Once you have the text systematically extracted, you could use basic NLP or keyword extraction libraries (like nltk or spaCy) to do further analysis, e.g.:
	•	Counting how many times a concept appears.
	•	Clustering related terms.
	•	Building a simple glossary of definitions.

Putting It All Together
	1.	Parsing: Run a Python script to transform raw .md content into structured CSV(s).
	2.	Structuring: Merge and unify the extracted data into a single “Week2_Concepts.csv” for a consolidated view of headings, bullet points, tables, and key terms.
	3.	Visualizing: Use Graphviz or Mermaid to build conceptual maps. This helps you see the relationships and hierarchy at a glance.
	4.	Managing Assets: Copy or link in PDFs, images, or other references to tie everything together in a single output folder.
	5.	Automation: Wrap these steps into a shell script or build system so it’s all reproducible with a single command.

This pipeline ensures that whenever your Week 2 materials change, you just rerun the script to get fresh spreadsheets, updated concept maps, and a curated collection of resources—making your homework analysis faster, more consistent, and less error-prone.

elow is a conceptual outline that incorporates the challenges (API call costs, inconsistencies between providers, validation, rate limiting) into a robust workflow. It also adds enhancements (caching, configurable analysis depth, modular analysis components, and error handling) to extend your current pipeline for analyzing and distilling your Week 2 homework (or any other materials). This approach can apply to any multi-API system where you’re orchestrating calls to LLMs or other services.

1. HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW

You likely have an automation script or pipeline that performs these tasks:
	1.	Gather Input Resources (e.g., week2_overview.md, homework_week_two_assignment_one.md)
	2.	Parse & Extract Structured Data (e.g., convert markdown to CSV/JSON)
	3.	Generate Spreadsheets & Concept Maps (Graphviz, Mermaid, etc.)
	4.	(Optionally) Use AI or LLM Calls for summarizing, validating, or extracting more nuanced insights
	5.	Output/Distribute results (CSV, PDF, diagrams, etc.)

The challenges and enhancements specifically pertain to step (4) and, more generally, how to manage the overall pipeline efficiently when calls to external APIs are involved.

2. CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

2.1 API Call Costs
	•	Problem: High usage of external AI or LLM APIs can quickly become expensive if each analysis step spawns multiple requests.
	•	Solution:
	1.	Caching: Before sending a new request to an API, check if you’ve previously asked the same (or similar) query.
	•	Store responses in a local database or caching layer (Redis, SQLite, JSON file, etc.).
	•	Use a “hash” of the request as a key. If a match is found, reuse the cached response.
	2.	Batching: Combine multiple small requests into a single larger request if the API allows it.

2.2 Inconsistencies Between Providers
	•	Problem: Multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) can produce different interpretations or styles.
	•	Solution:
	1.	Provider Selection Layer: Implement a small Python class or function that decides which provider to call based on the task. For instance, prefer one model for summarization, another for code generation.
	2.	Ensemble or Voting: For critical tasks where accuracy is paramount, you can run the same prompt through multiple LLMs, then compare or do a “vote” to converge on the best answer. This does increase cost unless carefully restricted.

2.3 Validation of Results
	•	Problem: LLMs can hallucinate or produce inaccurate data.
	•	Solution:
	1.	Schema Validation: If you’re expecting a JSON output with a specific schema (e.g., a list of key terms, definitions, references), parse the output strictly. If the LLM returns something malformed, either prompt for correction automatically or flag it.
	2.	Cross-Checking: If your pipeline extracts numerical or factual data (e.g., truth tables, 2’s complement conversions), do a second pass to confirm correctness. This can be done with a simple Python function or a second AI call (“Please verify the correctness of this data.”).
	3.	Human-in-the-Loop: For critical or ambiguous tasks, incorporate a step where the system shows the LLM’s output to you for acceptance or rejection.

2.4 Rate Limits
	•	Problem: Many APIs have per-minute or per-day usage limits. Exceeding them can cause errors or forced backoffs.
	•	Solution:
	1.	Global Rate-Limiting: Implement a queue or a token-bucket approach so that calls to each API are spaced out according to the allowed rate.
	2.	Bulk Retrieval: If your usage pattern is predictable, schedule calls during off-peak hours or gather requests before firing them at once (within rate-limit constraints).
	3.	Fallback Handling: If you hit a limit with one provider, your pipeline can temporarily switch to a backup, or pause and resume.

3. POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS

3.1 Caching to Avoid Redundant Calls
	•	Implementation:
	•	A simple approach is to store (prompt, provider, model) -> response as a key-value in a JSON or SQLite.
	•	Checking cache first reduces repeated costs significantly, especially if you frequently re-run the same requests (for example, each time you build or re-build your pipeline).

3.2 Configurable AI Analysis Depth
	•	Use Case: Sometimes you want a short summary or shallow analysis; other times, you want an in-depth review.
	•	Implementation:
	•	.env or config file: Add a parameter like ANALYSIS_DEPTH=shallow|moderate|deep.
	•	In your AI-calling function, build the prompt and instructions based on that depth (e.g., deeper analyses might ask for more detail or multiple re-check passes).
	•	You can also set a parameter for how many times to re-call the API for iterative refinement.

3.3 Modular, Pluggable Analysis Components
	•	Goal: Let your pipeline easily swap or add new modules for specialized tasks.
	•	Implementation:
	1.	Class-based Modules: For example, have classes like KeyTermExtractor, ConceptSummarizer, HomeworkValidator. Each has a run() method that takes input text or data frames.
	2.	Pipelines: Use a Python orchestration tool (like prefect or luigi) or a custom script that runs each module in sequence.
	3.	Config-Driven: In your pipeline config, specify which modules to run. If you only want to do bullet extraction and concept mapping, skip advanced AI modules.

3.4 Robust Error Handling
	•	Goal: Prevent the pipeline from failing silently or losing data.
	•	Implementation:
	1.	Try/Except Blocks: For each external call, handle exceptions (e.g., rate limit, invalid response).
	2.	Logging: Use Python’s logging module or a third-party solution (like loguru) to record failures, timestamps, and any relevant debug info in a structured log file.
	3.	Retry Logic: If an API call fails due to a network issue, auto-retry a few times with exponential backoff.

5. SAMPLE CODE SNIPPETS

Below are short examples demonstrating how you might integrate these concepts.

5.1 Example of a Cached AI Call in Python

import time
import hashlib
import json
import os

CACHE_FILE = "ai_responses_cache.json"

# Simple in-memory cache; you can use something more robust if needed
if os.path.exists(CACHE_FILE):
    with open(CACHE_FILE, 'r') as f:
        cache = json.load(f)
else:
    cache = {}

def cached_ai_call(prompt, provider, model, analysis_depth):
    """
    Example function that checks a local JSON cache before making an API call.
    """
    cache_key = hashlib.sha256((prompt + provider + model + analysis_depth).encode()).hexdigest()

    # 1) Check Cache
    if cache_key in cache:
        return cache[cache_key]

    # 2) Rate limiting logic (placeholder)
    time.sleep(1)  # e.g., wait 1 second between calls

    # 3) Make the actual AI call (pseudo-code)
    # result = call_provider_api(prompt, provider, model, analysis_depth)
    result = f"Simulated response for {prompt} with {provider}/{model}/{analysis_depth}"

    # 4) Validate the result (basic schema check, for instance)
    if not isinstance(result, str):
        raise ValueError("Unexpected response format from AI provider")

    # 5) Save to cache
    cache[cache_key] = result
    with open(CACHE_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(cache, f, indent=2)

    return result

5.2 Handling Multiple Providers with a Simple Factory

def call_provider_api(prompt, provider, model, analysis_depth):
    """
    Example of selecting which provider API to call.
    In production, you'd have keys in an .env file or config system.
    """
    if provider == "OpenAI":
        return call_openai(prompt, model, analysis_depth)
    elif provider == "Anthropic":
        return call_claude(prompt, model, analysis_depth)
    elif provider == "Google":
        return call_google_model(prompt, model, analysis_depth)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Provider {provider} not recognized.")

5.3 Example Rate-Limiting with a Simple Token Bucket

import time

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, calls_per_minute):
        self.interval = 60.0 / calls_per_minute
        self.last_call_time = 0.0

    def acquire(self):
        current_time = time.time()
        wait_time = self.interval - (current_time - self.last_call_time)
        if wait_time > 0:
            time.sleep(wait_time)
        self.last_call_time = time.time()

# Usage:
# limiter = RateLimiter(calls_per_minute=30)
# ...
# limiter.acquire()  # block if needed, then call the API

6. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED STEPS
	1.	Organize code for each week in separate directories (as you’re already doing).
	2.	Integrate caching to address cost issues and unnecessary re-calls to LLMs.
	3.	Add rate-limiting to gracefully handle API usage constraints.
	4.	Use config files (.env, JSON, YAML) to define model keys, usage parameters, and an “analysis depth” variable.
	5.	Implement a basic validation layer that cross-checks or enforces expected schema/format.
	6.	Wrap everything in an orchestration script (shell script or Python script) that calls each step sequentially, and logs or prints any errors.

With these enhancements, your pipeline becomes more cost-efficient, flexible, reliable, and easy to maintain as you continue expanding your digital logic homework analyses (and any other coursework that might require structured analysis and AI-driven insights).

Below is a detailed, step-by-step guide for each enhancement you listed—more intelligent parsing, automated relationship discovery, enhanced concept mapping, multi-perspective analysis, and a flexible, extensible pipeline—complete with specific implementation approaches and code snippets. These build upon the code examples you shared, expanding them with additional clarity and best practices.

1. More Intelligent Parsing Beyond Regex

Why It Matters
	•	Basic regex parsing often misses complex Markdown features (tables, code blocks, nested lists, front-matter).
	•	Advanced Markdown parsers or AI-based parsing can give you richer, more structured data (e.g., properly capturing sub-bullet levels, code fences, images, etc.).

Implementation Approaches
	1.	Use a Python Markdown Parser Library (e.g., markdown, mistune, mdformat, commonmark):
	•	Converts Markdown into an AST (abstract syntax tree).
	•	Lets you systematically traverse headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, etc.
	2.	Leverage an LLM for AI-Enhanced Parsing:
	•	Feed raw Markdown text to an LLM with instructions: “Analyze the structure. Extract headings, bullet points, code fences, front matter, etc.”
	•	Compare or merge results with a standard Markdown parser to catch nuances the LLM might interpret differently.
	3.	Hybrid Approach (Recommended):
	•	First pass: standard Markdown library to parse a baseline structure (headings, paragraphs, lists).
	•	Second pass: LLM call to interpret or label the content (e.g., identify definitions, examples, or context-specific tags).
	•	Merge the two results to get robust, structured data.

Code Example (Using Mistune + AI)

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import mistune
import re
import os
from provider_manager import ProviderManager  # your custom multi-LLM manager

class MyMarkdownRenderer(mistune.Renderer):
    """Custom renderer that stores parsed elements in a structured format."""
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.headers = []
        self.bullets = []
        self.paragraphs = []

    def header(self, text, level, raw=None):
        self.headers.append({'level': level, 'text': text})
        return ''

    def list_item(self, text):
        # Capture bullet items
        self.bullets.append(text.strip())
        return ''

    def paragraph(self, text):
        self.paragraphs.append(text.strip())
        return ''

def ai_enhanced_parse_markdown(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # 1) Parse with Mistune (or another Markdown parser)
    renderer = MyMarkdownRenderer()
    markdown = mistune.Markdown(renderer=renderer)
    markdown(content)

    provider_manager = ProviderManager()
    llm_result = provider_manager.analyze_content(
        content,

    ai_headers = llm_result.get('headers', [])
    ai_bullets = llm_result.get('bullets', [])

    merged_headers = renderer.headers + ai_headers

    # Potential: deduplicate or unify
    # You can add more logic if LLM returns a separate structure for sub-bullets, etc.

    return merged_headers, merged_bullets, renderer.paragraphs

2. Automated Relationship Discovery

Why It Matters
	•	Once you have structured content (concepts, definitions, references), you often want to find logical or semantic relationships between them (e.g., “2’s complement depends on binary representation,” “K-map is used for Boolean minimization,” etc.).
	•	Doing this manually can be time-consuming; an AI-based approach can find unexpected or subtle connections.

Implementation Approaches
	1.	NLP Graph Construction:
	•	Use an LLM or an NLP pipeline to identify subject -> predicate -> object relationships (like “K-map -> is used for -> minimization”).
	•	Build a directed graph (in memory or in a graph database like Neo4j).
	2.	Keyword/Concept Clustering:
	•	After extracting key terms (e.g., “two’s complement,” “SOP,” “thermometer code”), run a similarity check or embedding-based approach to cluster related concepts.
	3.	Cross-Document Linking:
	•	If the same concept appears in multiple files (overview, homework, etc.), link them in your relationship graph.

Code Example (Concept Graph Discovery)

def discover_relationships(consolidated_text):
    """
    Use an AI provider to find relationships between extracted concepts.
    Returns a dictionary in the form { concept: [related_concepts] }
    """
    provider_manager = ProviderManager()
    results = provider_manager.analyze_content(
        consolidated_text,
        task="relationship_discovery"
    )
    # Example structure from AI:
    # {
    #   "concept_relationships": {
    #       "Two's complement": ["Binary inversion", "Signed integer representation"],
    #       "K-map": ["Boolean minimization", "Prime implicants"]
    #   }
    # }
    return results.get('concept_relationships', {})

def automated_relationship_discovery(headers, bullets, paragraphs):
    """
    Combines raw parsed data into a single text block and uses AI to find relationships.
    """
    text_lines = []
    for h in headers:
        text_lines.append(f"Header L{h['level']}: {h['text']}")
    for b in bullets:
        text_lines.append(f"Bullet: {b}")
    for p in paragraphs:
        text_lines.append(f"Paragraph: {p}")

    consolidated_text = "\n".join(text_lines)
    return discover_relationships(consolidated_text)

3. Enhanced Concept Mapping

Why It Matters
	•	Traditional concept maps might just show headings and subheadings. By using AI to identify relationships, synonyms, or definitions, you can create rich, dynamic maps.

Implementation Approaches
	1.	Knowledge Graph Generation:
	•	Represent each concept as a node.
	•	The discovered relationships become edges.
	•	Tools: Graphviz (DOT format), Mermaid, or an interactive JS library (D3.js).
	2.	Hierarchical + Cross-Linking:
	•	Some concepts will be hierarchical (2’s complement under binary representation), while others cross-link (2’s complement <-> negative numbers, K-map <-> boolean functions).
	3.	Annotation of Edges:
	•	Instead of just “A -> B,” store descriptive text (e.g., “depends on,” “used for,” “contrasts with”).

Code Example (Enhanced Graphviz)

def ai_create_enhanced_graphviz(headers, bullets, paragraphs, dot_output_path):
    # 1) Automated relationship discovery
    concept_graph = automated_relationship_discovery(headers, bullets, paragraphs)

    # 2) Generate DOT
    with open(dot_output_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write('digraph G {\n')
        f.write('  rankdir=LR;\n')
        f.write('  node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#e0f7fa"];\n')

        # For simplicity, we'll treat each concept as a node
        all_concepts = set(concept_graph.keys())
        for related_list in concept_graph.values():
            for rc in related_list:
                all_concepts.add(rc)

        # Write nodes
        for concept in all_concepts:
            safe_concept = concept.replace('"', '\\"')  # escape quotes
            f.write(f'  "{safe_concept}";\n')

        # Write edges
        for concept, related_concepts in concept_graph.items():
            for related in related_concepts:
                f.write(f'  "{concept}" -> "{related}";\n')
        f.write('}\n')
    print(f"Enhanced concept map generated at {dot_output_path}")

4. Multi-Perspective Analysis

Why It Matters
	•	LLMs differ in tone, accuracy, style, and domain expertise. Combining them can yield a more robust or comprehensive result.
	•	For example, you may want OpenAI for logical consistency, Anthropic (Claude) for more human-like summarization, Google for domain-specific knowledge.

Implementation Approaches
	1.	Provider Manager:
	•	A single class that orchestrates calls to multiple LLMs.
	•	It returns a dictionary with each provider’s result.
	2.	Aggregation/Voting:
	•	If you want a single “best” result, implement a simple aggregator: e.g., if three providers produce a list of bullet points, unify them, or rank them by frequency.
	3.	Side-by-Side View:
	•	For some tasks, simply store each provider’s output in separate fields so the user can manually compare them.

Code Example (ProviderManager & Multi-Perspective)

# provider_manager.py
import os

class ProviderManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load API keys from environment or config
        self.openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        self.anthropic_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
        self.google_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
        # Additional setup...

    def analyze_content(self, text, task="general"):
        """
        Calls multiple providers, returning a dict with each provider's results.
        """
        results = {}
        # 1) Call OpenAI
        if self.openai_key:
            results["OpenAI"] = self._call_openai(text, task)
        # 2) Call Anthropic
        if self.anthropic_key:
            results["Anthropic"] = self._call_anthropic(text, task)
        # 3) Call Google
        if self.google_key:
            results["Google"] = self._call_google(text, task)

        return results

    def _call_openai(self, text, task):
        # Example pseudo-call
        # return openai_api(text, self.openai_key, model="gpt-4", custom_task=task)
        return {"headers": [], "bullets": [], "concept_relationships": {}}

    def _call_anthropic(self, text, task):
        # Example pseudo-call
        # return anthropic_api(text, self.anthropic_key, model="claude-v1", custom_task=task)
        return {"headers": [], "bullets": [], "concept_relationships": {}}

    def _call_google(self, text, task):
        # Example pseudo-call
        # return google_palm_api(text, self.google_key, model="gemini", custom_task=task)
        return {"headers": [], "bullets": [], "concept_relationships": {}}

How to Aggregate:

def unify_headers(ai_parsing_results):
    unified_headers = []
    for provider, result in ai_parsing_results.items():
        if 'headers' in result:
            unified_headers.extend(result['headers'])
    # De-duplicate or unify logic
    return list({(h['level'], h['text']) for h in unified_headers})

5. Flexible, Extensible Pipeline

Why It Matters
	•	A well-structured pipeline can grow as you add new weeks’ content, new analysis tools, new AI providers, or new output formats.

Implementation Approaches
	1.	Modular Architecture:
	•	Separate each major step (parsing, concept discovery, mapping, final output) into its own script or function.
	2.	Configuration-Driven:
	•	Let a config file or environment variables control which steps run, which providers to call, and how deeply to analyze.
	3.	Orchestration:
	•	Use a simple shell script, or for more advanced needs, a tool like Make, Poetry scripts, or Prefect for workflow automation.
	4.	Error Handling & Logging:
	•	Handle exceptions gracefully (e.g., if one provider is down, skip or fallback to another).
	•	Log all steps to a file so you can debug issues easily.

Example: Updated build_pipeline.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Step 1: AI-enhanced markdown parsing
echo "Parsing homework markdown with AI..."
python ai_enhanced_parse_markdown.py ../resources/week2/homework_week_two_assignment_one.md ../output/week2/spreadsheets/homework_parsed.json

python ai_enhanced_parse_markdown.py ../resources/week2/week_two_overview.md ../output/week2/spreadsheets/overview_parsed.json

# Step 2: Merge & unify parsed data + discover relationships
echo "Merging & discovering relationships..."
python merge_and_discover.py ../output/week2/spreadsheets/homework_parsed.json ../output/week2/spreadsheets/overview_parsed.json ../output/week2/spreadsheets/week2_concepts.json

# Step 3: Generate enhanced concept map (Graphviz)
echo "Generating concept map..."
python ai_create_concept_map.py ../output/week2/spreadsheets/week2_concepts.json ../output/week2/diagrams/week2_map.dot
dot -Tpdf ../output/week2/diagrams/week2_map.dot -o ../output/week2/diagrams/week2_map.pdf

# Step 4: Copy references
echo "Copying references..."
mkdir -p ../output/week2/references
cp ../resources/week2/assets/* ../output/week2/references/

echo "Pipeline complete!"

Example: merge_and_discover.py

import sys
import json
from automated_relationship_discovery import automated_relationship_discovery

if len(sys.argv) < 4:
    print("Usage: merge_and_discover.py <file1.json> <file2.json> <output.json>")
    sys.exit(1)

file1 = sys.argv[1]
file2 = sys.argv[2]
output_file = sys.argv[3]

def load_parsed_data(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)

data1 = load_parsed_data(file1)  # { "headers": [...], "bullets": [...], "paragraphs": [...] }
data2 = load_parsed_data(file2)

merged_headers = data1['headers'] + data2['headers']
merged_bullets = data1['bullets'] + data2['bullets']
merged_paragraphs = data1['paragraphs'] + data2['paragraphs']

concept_graph = automated_relationship_discovery(merged_headers, merged_bullets, merged_paragraphs)

with open(output_file, 'w') as out:
    json.dump({
        "headers": merged_headers,
        "bullets": merged_bullets,
        "paragraphs": merged_paragraphs,
        "concept_graph": concept_graph
    }, out, indent=2)

print(f"Merged concepts and discovered relationships saved to {output_file}")

Final Thoughts & Summary
	1.	More Intelligent Parsing: Combine a robust Markdown parser with LLM-based interpretation to capture all structural nuances (headings, bullet nesting, tables, front-matter, code blocks, etc.).
	2.	Automated Relationship Discovery: Use AI to detect conceptual connections, building a knowledge graph of how key ideas interrelate.
	3.	Enhanced Concept Mapping: Generate dynamic diagrams (Graphviz, Mermaid, D3.js) from your knowledge graph, revealing cross-cutting themes and hierarchies.
	4.	Multi-Perspective Analysis: Leverage different AI providers for deeper or more varied insight, optionally combining or comparing results.
	5.	Flexible, Extensible Pipeline: Keep each step modular, orchestrate them via shell scripts or a workflow tool, and store configuration in .env or other config files for easy updates.

By adopting these detailed implementations, your pipeline moves beyond simple text extraction and becomes a powerful, AI-driven knowledge system—capable of parsing, analyzing, and visualizing your coursework (and beyond) from multiple angles, with minimal manual effort.


Below is a high-level action plan outlining how to put these recommendations into practice, along with specific items you’ll want to create or modify. Each step assumes you’ve already got the basic project structure (with weekly directories, parsing scripts, etc.) and now want to upgrade it with caching, rate-limiting, and a robust configuration system.

1. Update Environment Configuration

Goal
	•	Centralize all API keys, rate-limit settings, and usage parameters so they’re easy to manage and adjust.

Action Items
	1.	Create or update your .env file with the relevant keys and settings:
	•	OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY
	•	RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=1 (or specify calls per minute)
	•	ANALYSIS_DEPTH=shallow|moderate|deep (or numeric levels)
	2.	Adopt a library like python-dotenv so your scripts can read environment variables automatically:

pip install python-dotenv

Then in Python:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
import os

OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
ANALYSIS_DEPTH = os.getenv("ANALYSIS_DEPTH", "shallow")


	3.	Keep .env out of version control if it has sensitive keys. Provide a .env.example or config.example file for others.

2. Install Additional Dependencies

Goal
	•	Ensure your environment supports advanced AI parsing, rate-limiting, logging, etc.

Action Items
	1.	Add AI provider libraries (if not already installed):
	•	openai Python client (pip install openai)
	•	anthropic Python client, or any other relevant SDK
	2.	Set up caching:
	•	For a lightweight approach: pip install requests-cache or pip install diskcache
	•	If you prefer a database approach: pip install redis (and run a Redis server)
	3.	Install a robust Markdown parser if you plan to move beyond regex:
	•	pip install mistune or pip install markdown
	4.	Choose a logging library:
	•	Python built-in logging or something like loguru

Create or update your requirements.txt (or pyproject.toml if using Poetry) with these dependencies.

3. Integrate with Existing Parsing Scripts

Goal
	•	Enhance your current parse_markdown.py or similar scripts to incorporate caching, config-based settings, rate-limiting, and AI calls.

Action Items
	1.	Read environment variables in each script to set parameters (e.g., ANALYSIS_DEPTH, RATE_LIMIT_DELAY).
	2.	Add a caching layer to store responses from the AI, preventing re-calls for the same prompt:

import hashlib
import time
from diskcache import Cache

cache = Cache('./cache_dir')

def cached_ai_call(prompt, model):
    key = hashlib.sha256((prompt + model).encode()).hexdigest()
    if key in cache:
        return cache[key]

    # Rate limit
    time.sleep(float(os.getenv("RATE_LIMIT_DELAY", "1")))

    # Make the API call here...
    response = call_ai_api(prompt, model)
    cache[key] = response
    return response


	3.	Modify your existing parse functions to call this cached_ai_call instead of making direct, repeated API requests.

4. Set Up Proper Logging

Goal
	•	Collect logs from each step of the pipeline (parsing, AI calls, merging data). This makes debugging easier.

Action Items
	1.	Initialize a logger at the entry point of your application:

import logging
from logging import handlers

# Example rotating file handler
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
handler = handlers.RotatingFileHandler('pipeline.log', maxBytes=5_000_000, backupCount=3)
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)

logger.info("Logging initialized for pipeline.")


	2.	Log at key steps in your parsing and AI scripts:

logger.info("Starting markdown parse for file: %s", filepath)
...
logger.error("Failed to parse table in file: %s", filepath)
...
logger.info("AI call to %s complete", provider)


	3.	Consider different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to separate normal flow from errors or debug details.

5. Create Configuration Files for Different Analysis Scenarios

Goal
	•	Quickly switch between “shallow” vs. “deep” analysis, or try different AI providers or language models without changing code.

Action Items
	1.	Use a separate config/ directory:
	•	config/shallow.env
	•	config/deep.env
	•	config/medium.env
	•	Each can override variables like ANALYSIS_DEPTH and specific model settings.
	2.	Update your pipeline scripts to accept a config file path:

# usage: ./build_pipeline.sh shallow
# loads config/shallow.env

CONFIG_FILE=config/$1.env
if [ -f "$CONFIG_FILE" ]; then
    export $(cat "$CONFIG_FILE" | xargs)
else
    echo "Config file $CONFIG_FILE not found."
    exit 1
fi


	3.	Include additional keys for advanced scenarios:
	•	e.g. PROVIDER_PRIORITY=OpenAI,Anthropic,Google
	•	MAX_TOKENS=3000
	•	TEMPERATURE=0.7 (for generation variety)

This way, you can quickly run your pipeline under different configurations by specifying a single argument.

Putting It All Together

Here’s a big-picture view of how you might structure your updated system:
	1.	Environment & Config
	•	.env or multiple .env files in config/ define your default or scenario-based settings (API keys, rate-limit, analysis depth, provider priority, etc.).
	2.	Dependency Management
	•	requirements.txt (or pyproject.toml) ensures you have python-dotenv, mistune, diskcache (or redis), requests-cache, loguru (or use built-in logging).
	3.	Updated Scripts
	•	ai_enhanced_parse_markdown.py: Now reads from environment variables, uses caching, logs steps, and calls multiple AI providers based on ANALYSIS_DEPTH.
	•	merge_and_discover.py: Uses caching for any AI relationship discovery calls, logs progress, merges data from multiple sources, respects ANALYSIS_DEPTH.
	•	build_pipeline.sh (or Makefile): Accepts a config scenario (e.g. shallow, deep), exports environment variables, calls each script in sequence, and logs or prints any errors.
	4.	Logging & Validation
	•	A top-level logger captures messages from each step.
	•	Basic validation checks the schema of AI returns (e.g., ensures we have headers, bullets, etc.).
	5.	Multiple Environments
	•	E.g., ./build_pipeline.sh shallow vs. ./build_pipeline.sh deep seamlessly switch analysis modes.

This approach ensures that your pipeline:
	•	Remains organized (weekly directories, consistent structure).
	•	Controls costs (via caching, rate-limiting).
	•	Operates reliably (logging, validation).
	•	Adapts easily to new analysis scenarios (config-driven).

With these five steps fully implemented, your pipeline will be well-equipped to handle the challenges of cost, rate-limiting, advanced AI parsing, flexible analysis depths, and robust logging. This positions you for smooth expansion in future weeks or additional course content with minimal rework.
